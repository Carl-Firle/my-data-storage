N2  - BACKGROUND: Many studies have examined the perception of musical emotion using excerpts from familiar music that includes highly expressed emotions to classify emotional choices. However, using familiar music to study musical emotions in people with acquired hearing loss could produce ambiguous results as to whether the emotional perception is due to previous experiences or listening to the current musical stimuli. To overcome this limitation, we developed new musical stimuli to study emotional perception without the effects of episodic memory. METHODS: A musician was instructed to compose five melodies with evenly distributed pitches around 1 kHz. The melodies were created to express the emotions of happy, sad, angry, tender, and neutral. To evaluate whether these melodies expressed the intended emotions, two methods were applied. First, we classified the expressed emotions of melodies with selected musical features from 60 features using genetic algorithm-based k-nearest neighbors. Second, forty-four people with normal hearing participated in an online survey regarding the emotional perception of music based on dimensional and discrete approaches to evaluate the musical stimuli set. RESULTS: Twenty-four selected musical features produced classification for intended emotions with an accuracy of 76%. The results of the online survey in the normal hearing (NH) group showed that the intended emotions were selected significantly more often than the others. K-means clustering analysis revealed that melodies with arousal and valence ratings corresponded to representative quadrants of interest. Additionally, the applicability of the stimuli was tested in 4 individuals with high-frequency hearing loss. CONCLUSION: By applying the individuals with NH, the musical stimuli were shown to classify emotions with high accuracy, as expressed. These results confirm that the set of musical stimuli can be used to study the perceived emotion in music, demonstrating the validity of the musical stimuli, independent of innate musical bias such as due to episodic memory. Furthermore, musical stimuli could be helpful for further studying perceived musical emotion in people with hearing loss because of the controlled pitch for each emotion.

N2  - Music is among the most important artistic, cultural, and entertainment modalities in any society. With the proliferation of music genres and the technological advances that allow people to consume music in any location and at any time, music over-exposure has become a significant public health issue. Music-induced hearing loss has a great deal in common with noise-induced hearing loss. However, there are important differences that make music a unique insult to the auditory system and a unique threat to public health. Its unique properties also make it a potentially valuable asset in sound conditioning paradigms. This review discusses hearing loss from noise and music, comparing and contrasting the two. Recent research on music-induced hearing loss is reviewed, followed by discussion of the differences in music-induced hearing loss between performers and consumers. The review concludes with a discussion of the potential of music as a sound conditioning stimulus to protect against acquired hearing loss.

N2  - Introduction: Sensorineural hearing loss caused by exposure to noise is one of the most frequent causes of deafness. Professional musicians have significant occupational exposure to high levels of noise. Use of hearing protection among musicians could substantially prevent hearing damage, though the rate of use is quite low. Methods and material: A questionnaire on the use of protective hearing devices, hearing care, and subjective judgments of hearing difficulties was completed by a group of classical musicians from Spain. We analysed the frequency of device use by instrument based on contingency tables analysed by χ2 tests. Results: One hundred and ninety-four Spanish classical orchestral musicians voluntarily completed the questionnaire. The percentage of musicians who reported using hearing protection in our survey was very low and varied with the type of instrument played. However, we found a high prevalence of subjective auditory disorders within this group. Conclusion: Few Spanish musicians use hearing protection. Training on hearing-loss prevention in this field and better protective devices could increase device use and improve the auditory health of this group.

N2  - This study aimed to determine (a) the influence of noise exposure background (NEB) on the peripheral and central auditory system functioning and (b) the influence of NEB on speech recognition in noise abilities in student musicians. Twenty non-musician students with self-reported low NEB and 18 student musicians with self-reported high NEB completed a battery of tests that consisted of physiological measures, including auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) at three different stimulus rates (11.3 Hz, 51.3 Hz, and 81.3 Hz), and P300, and behavioral measures including conventional and extended high-frequency audiometry, consonant–vowel nucleus–consonant (CNC) word test and AzBio sentence test for assessing speech perception in noise abilities at −9, −6, −3, 0, and +3 dB signal to noise ratios (SNRs). The NEB was negatively associated with performance on the CNC test at all five SNRs. A negative association was found between NEB and performance on the AzBio test at 0 dB SNR. No effect of NEB was found on the amplitude and latency of P300 and the ABR wave I amplitude. More investigations of larger datasets with different NEB and longitudinal measurements are needed to investigate the influence of NEB on word recognition in noise and to understand the specific cognitive processes contributing to the impact of NEB on word recognition in noise.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to establish whether preferred music-listening level differed between musicians and non-musicians, and whether preferred music-listening level was related to music genre preference and lifetime noise exposure. Seventeen musicians (mean age = 29.06 years, SD = 4.74; female n = 9) and 17 non-musicians (mean age = 28.94 years, SD = 4.63; female n = 9) with clinically normal hearing were recruited to listen to six music samples from different genres and one sample of environmental sounds. Participants adjusted the listening level [dB(A)] until the music was loud and enjoyable. This was repeated three times and an average was taken. Lifetime noise exposure was estimated using the Noise Exposure Structured Interview. Preferred music-listening levels of musicians were significantly higher than non-musicians. The preferred music-listening level differed with genre preference, with the participants’ favorite tracks being played at 11 dB higher level than the least favorite tracks. There was also a positive correlation between lifetime noise exposure and preferred music-listening level. Musicians prefer to listen to music at higher level than non-musicians and thus may be more susceptible to noise induced hearing loss than non-musicians. As such, musicians in particular would benefit from simple changes in lifestyle and listening habits, including increased awareness of the risks of higher listening levels, as well as the use of hearing protection.

N2  - Purpose: The aim of this study was to examine whether the medial olivocochlear hearing system functions, the high frequency hearing thresholds and speech discrimination in noise performance can guide us in assessing the risk of hearing loss among violinists. It is aimed to investigate possible hearing damage that is not reflected in pure tone hearing thresholds in violinists. Methods: The participants (n = 50) who have normal hearing and the ages of 18–30 were included in this study in two groups: violinists and controls who are unrelated to music. High frequency audiometer, auditory figure ground test (AFG) for speech discrimination in noise performance, Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emission (DPOAE) and contralateral suppression on DPOAE for medial olivocochlear system function tests were applied to all participants as well as routine audiological tests. Results: The high frequency hearing thresholds were obtained higher in violinists compared to the controls. In violinists, the AFG test scores and the suppression amount at 1 kHz were lower than the controls. In addition, DPOAE responses at 4–6 kHz were obtained lower in violinists (p < 0.05). Conclusion: The reason for high frequency hearing loss, decreased DPOAE response amplitudes, and poor medial olivocochlear function in violinists can be explained by the long-term exposure to high-level noise caused by the violin, one of the closest musical instruments. Routine and comprehensive audiological follow-up is crucial for musicians.

N2  - Congenital amusia is a neurodevelopmental disorder of music processing, which includes impaired pitch memory, associated to abnormalities in the right fronto-temporal network. Previous research has shown that tonal structures (as defined by the Western musical system) improve short-term memory performance for short tone sequences (in comparison to atonal versions) in non-musician listeners, but the tonal structures only benefited response times in amusic individuals. We here tested the potential benefit of tonal structures for short-term memory with more complex musical material. Congenital amusics and their matched non-musician controls were required to indicate whether two excerpts were the same or different. Results confirmed impaired performance of amusic individuals in this short-term memory task. However, most importantly, both groups of participants showed better memory performance for tonal material than for atonal material. These results revealed that even amusics’ impaired short-term memory for pitch shows classical characteristics of short-term memory, that is the mnemonic benefit of structure in the to-be-memorized material. The findings show that amusic individuals have acquired some implicit knowledge of regularities of their culture, allowing for implicit processing of tonal structures, which benefits to memory even for complex material.

N2  - Accurate and objective assessment of higher order auditory processing is challenging and mainly relies on evaluations that require a subjects’ active participation in tests such as frequency discrimination or speech perception in noise. This study investigates the value of cortical auditory evoked potentials (CAEPs) evoked in response to auditory change stimuli, known as acoustic change complexes (ACCs), as an objective measurement of auditory performance in hearing impairment. Secondary objectives were to assess the effect of hearing loss and non-professional musical experience on the ACC, and compare the ACC to the ‘conventional’ CAEP evoked in response to stimulus onset. In 24 normal-hearing subjects, consisting of 12 musicians and 12 non-musicians, and 13 age-matched hearing-impaired subjects ACCs were recorded in response to 12% frequency increases at four base frequencies (0.5, 1, 2 and 4 kHz). ACC amplitudes and latencies were compared to frequency discrimination thresholds at each base frequency, and to speech perception in noise. Frequency discrimination and speech perception in noise were significantly better for larger ACC N1-P2 amplitudes and shorter N1 latencies, whereas both frequency discrimination and speech perception did not correlate with onset CAEP amplitude or latency. Multiple regression analysis for prediction of speech perception in noise revealed that the strongest model was obtained by averaging over three frequencies (1, 2 and 4 kHz) with two significant predictors: hearing loss (R2 = 0.52) and ACC latency (R2 = 0.35). Thus, explaining 87% of the variance, this model indicates that subjects with longer ACC latencies have worse speech perception in noise than subjects with comparable hearing thresholds and shorter ACC latencies. If hearing loss was removed from this model, the combination of ACC amplitude and latency over those three frequencies explained 74% of the total variance in speech perception in noise. There were no differences in frequency discrimination, speech perception, CAEP, or ACC between recreational musicians and non-musicians. We conclude that the objective ACC N1 latency is a good predictor of speech perception in noise. When confirmed in validation studies with larger numbers of subjects, it can aid clinicians in their evaluation of auditory performance and higher order processing, in particular when behavioral testing is unreliable.

N2  - Beethoven suffered from episodes of severe diarrhoea starting in his late teens, and increasing deafness from around the age of 28. He died from cirrhosis of the liver at the age of 57 in 1827. The nature of his diseases has been controversial ever since. Until recently, no one has invoked a single disease that would explain the chronic afflictions of his bowel, ears and liver. Suggested diagnoses have included lead poisoning, alcoholic cirrhosis, viral hepatitis, inflammatory eye disease, rheumatism, inflammatory bowel disease, Paget's disease of bone, Cogan's syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, otosclerosis, chronic pancreatitis, tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, Whipple's disease, renal papillary necrosis and syphilis. In 2005, Karmody and Bachor suggested that Beethoven suffered from chronic ulcerative colitis and its sequels. It is now known that ulcerative colitis may be complicated by sensorneural deafness and sclerosing cholangitis which progresses to cirrhosis, liver failure and death. These apparently diverse diseases are now believed to share an autoimmune pathogenesis. This explanation neatly joins together Beethoven's triad of diarrhoea, deafness and cirrhosis.

N2  - High-fidelity premolded earplugs (HiFi HPDs) are designed to provide relatively uniform attenuation across frequencies. The primary goal of this study was to verify the amount and flatness of individual user attenuation. HiFi HPD attenuation was measured using real-ear attenuation at threshold (REAT) measurements under circumaural earphones. Participants were 16 adults tested using commercial HiFi HPDs marketed for use at recreational music events and/or for use by musicians. There was significant individual variation in attenuation both within and across HiFi HPD brands. In addition to significant differences in achieved attenuation, there were significant differences in the uniformity of the attenuation. These data suggest verification of attenuation is important in musicians who are at risk for music-induced hearing disorders even when using "over-the-counter"uniform-fit HPDs.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: The U.S. Department of Defense employs more musicians than any other organization in the USA with over 6,000 musicians employed. Musculoskeletal pathologies, behavioral health disorders, hearing loss, and dystonias account for the majority of reasons a musician seek medical care. The aim of this study is to review recent medical literature documenting occupational hazards in musicians. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Authors performed a literature review of publications related to musician performance-related musculoskeletal disorders (PRMDs) and performance-related pain (PRP), behavioral health disorders, dystonias, and hearing loss, published from 2004 to 2019 PubMed. RESULTS: The search returned 174 possible articles which, after review and exclusion, yielded 88 articles. CONCLUSIONS: Medical literature suggests several risk factors for multiple disease categories. Practice time and history of PRMD/PRP were both associated with development of PRMD/PRP and focal dystonia. A history of behavioral health disorder was associated with development of focal dystonia. Clinicians should counsel their musician patients on strategies to minimize risks, and additional research is needed to identify specific causes of illnesses in musician populations.

N2  - Introduction: The aims of this study were to detect hearing loss in professional musicians and to assess its importance according to the duration of exposure and the intensity of the noise suffered. Materiel and methods: this cross-sectional epidemiological survey involved 241 musicians aged> 20 years with professional seniority> 2 years. The study included an analysis of working conditions with noise metrology (standard NF EN ISO 9612) and a medical assessment (questionnaire, clinical examination and audiometry). Results: The average age was 43.6 ± 10.5 years, the average seniority was 20.1 ± 6.1 years and the average weekly working time was 33.8 hours. The instruments played were percussion (49.4%), strings (29.4%), winds (14.9%) and brass (5%). Personal and family history of deafness was found in 5% of musicians not playing amplified music at loud levels and 14.5% playing amplified music at loud levels. 24.5% had normal audiometry, 51% sensorineural hearing loss, 14.5% conductive hearing loss and 9.9% mixed hearing loss. Sound exposure measurement showed high values in orchestras not playing loudly amplified music with intensities of around 98 dB (A). LAeq (3h) sound levels ranged from 94 to 106 dB (A). The LAeq (3h) to which musicians from orchestras playing loudly amplified music were exposed were between 98 and 108 dB (A) indoors and exceeded 112 dB (A) during outdoor concerts Conclusions: There is no information campaign on the preventing hearing impairment amongst musicians in our country. The prevention approach will be more accepted and applied if the representatives of musicians are involved in its elaboration

N2  - Previous studies suggest that musicians may be at higher risk for a set of medical problems; however, this literature has been limited by relatively small sample sizes, self-reports, and lack of controls. To address such limitations, we examined trends in the medical care of musicians in an Electronic Health Record database. On the basis of a collection of keywords and regular expressions in the patients’ clinical notes, we identified 9803 “musicians” that we matched for sex, median age (across the medical record), ethnicity, race, the length of record, and the number of visits with 49,015 controls. We fitted 1263 logistic regression models to determine whether the phenotype was correlated with musicianship. Two hundred fifty-seven phenotypes were more prevalent in musicians than controls after Bonferroni adjustment (P < 7.6 × 10–6), including diseases of the larynx and vocal cords (OR = 2.32 (95% CI: 2.25–2.40)), and hearing loss (OR = 1.36 (95% CI: 1.32–1.39)). Fifteen phenotypes were significantly more prevalent in controls than musicians, including coronary atherosclerosis (OR = 0.91 (95% CI: 0.89–0.94)). Although being a musician was related to many occupational health problems, we identified protective effects of musicianship in which certain disorders were less common in musicians than in controls, indicating that active musical engagement could have health benefits analogous to athletic engagement.

N2  - Significant problems have plagued medical and musicological researchers who wish to understand the complexities of Beethoven’s physical and mental health. The most significant is a lack of detailed information on the composer’s medical and mental conditions as they appeared and progressed. Though he consistently saw well-regarded doctors from around 1800 to his death, only one wrote a detailed description and only a few left information in the conversation books. Other problems are the limited medical knowledge about certain diseases at the time (such as the causes of deafness) and treatments with no or limited effectiveness (both for deafness and liver disease, for instance). Two additional problems are the focus of this essay. The first is the fact that studying the composer’s health and diseases is a cross-disciplinary endeavor that requires specialized knowledge both of medical science and of musicological expertise into every corner of Beethoven’s biography. The second concerns acquiring a knowledge of all the available sources that have survived to document the composer’s health and a critical assessment of their value.

N2  - Biographical accounts of famous artists usually try to relate the life story to the works (and vice versa). This gives the work a special “colour”, often the context for understanding for today’s recipients. This interrelation is complex and often judgmental, sometimes manipulative. Thus, medical (including psychiatric), characterological and psychodynamic assessments and interpretations must be made with great caution. Primary sources may be scanty and diagnostic concepts may have changed (Mozart died of hitzigem Frieselfieber [prickly heat fever]; in Hölderlin’s lifetime, schizophrenia or bipolar disorder did not yet “exist”). The attempt at a diagnostic classification often says more about the author and his time than about the artist (for example, the assessment of Robert Schumann’s or Friedrich Hölderlin’s mental illness). Against this background, elements of Ludwig van Beethoven’s biography are presented from a psychiatric perspective. In summary, Beethoven can be diagnosed with an alcohol use disorder. A pronounced hyperthymic temperament is likely to have had a clearly positive influence on the course of the disorder. In particular, no influence of the alcohol use disorder on the musical quality of the work can be proven. A clear episodic course of affective symptoms as in bipolar disorder is not demonstrable. The deafness caused a severe reduction in quality of life.

N2  - Introduction Several studies document the occurrence of hearing problems in musicians due to the constant exposure of loud sounds during activities such as group rehearsals, music performances and individual practices. Most of them reveal that many musicians are unaware of the risks faced in making music and are resistant to preventive actions. However, it seems reasonable to reverse this context based on the development of preventive actions during the graduation time of this public. Objectives To suggest a protocol of educational actions regarding hearing health with professors from higher education institutions in music. Methods The elaboration of the protocol of educational actions in hearing health was based on active learning and problematizing methodologies, to happen through activities developed in the academic environment. Results The protocol was developed to be applied in six modules, with of 1 h 30 min each, and contemplates the following topics (1) notions of anatomy-physiology of hearing, effects of high sound intensity, control measures and means of prevention of hearing loss; (2) acoustic characteristics of the work environment and workload in practical music classes and/or supervising internships (3) workshops towards the use of sound pressure level measurement apps and hearing screening apps; (4) composition and recording of jingles and pod-casts related to the risks of exposure to high intensity music to play for music students. Conclusion The development of the activities planned in the protocol can lead professors to incorporate the concepts and attitudes related to hearing health, to act as promotion agents to positively influence new generations of musicians with regard to that matter. The results must be continuously evaluated to identify the weaknesses and potential of the protocol.

N2  - AIM: To investigate the impact of tinnitus on professional musicians in the UK. BACK-GROUND: Tinnitus is the experience of sound when an external source is absent, primarily associated with the ageing process, hearing loss, and noise exposure. Amongst populations exposed to industrial noise, noise exposure and noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) have been found to be the factors most associated with tinnitus. The risk of NIHL amongst professional musicians is greater than that amongst the general population, meaning they may be at increased risk of tinnitus. METHODS: Seventy-four professional musicians completed an online survey involving closed and open-ended questions, and completed the Tinnitus fuctional Index (TFI) questionnaire. Descriptive statistics and thematic analysis of open-ended qualitative responses were used to analyse the data. RESULTS: Three themes were generated from the analysis of the responses to the open-ended questions. These themes were: (1) the impact of tinnitus on the lives of professional musicians, (2) professional musician experience of tinnitus services, support, and hearing health and safety, and (3) the support professional musicians want. The mean global TFI score for professional musicians was 39.05, interpreted as tinnitus being a moderate problem. Comparisons with general population data revealed lower TFI scores for the TFI subscales of ‘sense of control’ and ‘intrusiveness’ for professional musicians and higher for auditory difficulties associated with tinnitus amongst professional musicians. CONCLU-SION: Tinnitus can negatively impact on professional musicians’ lives. There is a need for bespoke self-help groups, awareness raising, and education to prevent tinnitus and promote hearing health among musicians.

N2  - Although music therapy may engender clinical benefits in patients with neurodegenerative disease, the impacts of social and musical factors of such activities on socio-emotional and motor engagements are poorly understood. To address this issue, non-verbal behaviors of 97 patients with or without major cognitive impairment (CI) were assessed when listening to music or a metronome in front of a musician who was present physically (live) or virtually (video). Socio-emotional engagement was quantified as emotional facial expression production and gaze direction. Motor engagement was quantified as overall body motion and the production of rhythmic movements. In both groups, positive facial expressions were more frequent and rhythmic motor activities lasted longer with music than with a metronome, and during a live performance rather than a video performance. Relative to patients without CI, patients with CI moved less with music, expressed fewer emotions, and spent less time looking at the musician in the video condition and in the metronome condition. The relative reductions in motor and socio-emotional engagements in patients with CI might be markers of disease progression. However, the presence of a live partner induces older adults to engage emotionally and physically in musical activities emphasizing the relevance of using live performance as motivational levers during music therapy.

N2  - Purpose: To verify the auditory-perceptual and acoustic effects of the semioccluded vocal tract exercise with Finnish tube on the vocal quality of a deaf musician. Methods: A seven-day protocol with Finnish tube was performed with guidance for its home replication twice a day. A 46-years-old man with profound bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, musician and composer participated. Before and after the application of the protocol had undergone tonal audiometry, nasofibrolaryngoscopy, acoustic analysis with Praat and auditory-perceptual evaluation of the voice with Voice Profile Analysis Scheme for Brazilian Portuguese. Results: The postintervention auditory-perceptual analysis identified reduction of the deviation in lip spreading, extensive labial range, raised tongue body, pharyngeal expansion, nasal resonance, larynx height, larynx and vocal tract tension and irregularity, pitch, speech rate, and a better respiratory support. The maximum phonation time reduced, probably because of elimination of the abrupt vocal attack and tension, articulatory deviations, improvement in voicing and the absence of the use of expiratory reserve air. The fundamental frequency became lower, and the first, second, third, and fourth formants became higher. The jitter increased, and the shimmer reduced. Conclusion: The use of the Finnish tube might have facilitated the voicing sensations in the deaf musician, by enhancing the tactile-kinesthetic perception of the vocal tract and brought a greater source-filter interaction.

N2  - Daily activities performed by music instructors generate high sound levels that could potentially lead to overexposure. Adverse outcomes associated with high-exposure to sound, such as hearing loss and tinnitus, can be especially devastating to music instructors as hearing is essential to both job performance and career reward. The primary objective of this study was to compare sound exposures of music instructors to recommended exposure limits. Secondary objectives were to identify high-exposure activities and to evaluate potential similar exposure groups by examining between- and within-worker exposure variability. Personal sound exposure measurements from music instructors were collected using dosimeters during full workdays for up to 4 weeks over multiple semesters at a university's school of music. Study participants completed an activity log to record work-related activities throughout each day of sampling. Dosimeters logged 1-sec sound equivalent levels in A-weighted decibels. These data were used to calculate 8-hr time-weighted averages, daily dose, and activity-specific contributions to that dose to determine if daily exposures exceeded the recommended limit of 85 dBA and to identify high-exposure activities that could be targeted for future intervention. Seventeen participants were sampled for a total of 200 days. Approximately one-third of daily exposures exceeded recommended limits. The groups with the highest exposures were brass and conducting instructors. Conductors experienced the highest between-day variability in daily exposures. Activities that contributed the most to daily dose included group rehearsals, personal practice sessions, and performances, while classes and administrative work did not substantially contribute to daily dose. Daily exposures were highly variable, ranging from 60-95 dBA (mean = 81 dBA, sd = 8 dBA), and were influenced by instructional area and musical activity. Future exposure assessments for music instructors should include sampling for multiple days, and those above-recommended limits should be placed into hearing conservation programs.

N2  - Professional musicians are at high risk of developing tinnitus due to their over-exposure to music at both occupational and recreational level. This is a 5-year long prospective case series study performed in the Musicians/Performing Arts Medicine Clinic of the 1st Otorhinolaryngology Department of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. A total of 274 professional musicians underwent thorough medical history, history of music exposure, assessment of the impact their hearing status has on their professional life (Musicians Hearing Handicap Index), behavioral (Pure Tone Audiometry, standard and extended high frequency) and objective audiometric tests (TEOAE and DPOAE). Standard pure tone audiometry thresholds were correlated with the presence of tinnitus only at high frequencies. Musicians with tinnitus had a clinical and significant higher MHHI score and the incidence of tinnitus was significantly higher in participants suffering from musculoskeletal disease and those with abnormal PTA. Participants' hours of practice were similar in those with tinnitus and those without. The tinnitus group (and in order of descending effect size) had significantly worse thresholds in high frequency audiometry (≥ 3000 Hz) as well as lower signal to noise ratios in DPOAE at almost all frequencies and in TEOAE at high frequencies (2.8 and 4 kHz). A subgroup analysis of the musicians with normal PTA, showed that those with tinnitus showed elevated thresholds in the extended high frequency. In conclusion, tinnitus occurrence in musicians with normal audiogram is potentially correlated with high frequency hearing loss and impaired otoacoustic emissions and these two examinations should be considered in this group.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Does wearing musicians’ earplugs while performing affect the quality of the performance? Can listeners perceive a difference in sound when musicians are performing with or without earplugs? The risk of hearing loss is a concern for musicians, but some are reluctant to wear hearing protection due to factors such as an inability to hear their own instrument properly and the possibility of decreased sound quality for listeners. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of musicians’ earplugs on instrumental pitch accuracy and the perception of tone quality, intonation, and dynamic contrast, as perceived by musicians and listeners. METHODS: Ten university studio faculty teachers were recorded performing single pitches and lyrical and technical passages, first without earplugs and then immediately after with earplugs. A sample of 8 studio faculty teachers and 88 undergraduate music education students completed a researcher-created music perception test of tone quality, intonation, and dynamic contrast. RESULTS: Objective analyses of the single pitch recordings made by faculty with and without earplugs indicate that pitch accuracy did not favor either condition consistently. Results from the perception test indicate that although both faculty and student listeners perceived some differences, the most frequent perception was that the audio pair was equal, and there was no clear difference between performing with and without earplugs in terms of tone quality, intonation, or dynamic contrast. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that musicians should feel confident that wearing musicians’ earplugs while performing does not adversely affect pitch accuracy or listeners’ perceptions of their timbre and dynamic control.
