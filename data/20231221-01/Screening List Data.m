problem in developed countries, despite reduced occupational noise exposure, \
strict standards for hearing protection and extensive public health awareness \

activities. This paper summarizes progress achieved recently in our knowledge \
of NIHL. It includes papers published between the years 2008-2011 (in \
English), which were identified by a literature search of accessible medical \
and other relevant databases. A substantial part of this research has been \
concerned with the risk of NIHL in the entertainment sector, particularly in \
professional, orchestral musicians. There are also constant concerns \
regarding noise exposure and hearing risk in \"hard to control\" occupations, \
such as farming and construction work. Although occupational noise has \
decreased since the early 1980s, the number of young people subject to social \
noise exposure has tripled. If the exposure limits from the Noise at Work \
Regulations are applied, discotheque music, rock concerts, as well as music \
from personal music players are associated with the risk of hearing loss in \
teenagers and young adults. Several recent research studies have increased \
the understanding of the pathomechanisms of acoustic trauma, the genetics of \
NIHL, as well as possible dietary and pharmacologic otoprotection in acoustic \
trauma. The results of these studies are very promising and offer grounds to \
expect that targeted therapies might help prevent the loss of sensory hair \
cells and protect the hearing of noise-exposed individuals. These studies \
emphasize the need to launch an improved noise exposure policy for hearing \
protection along with developing more efficient norms of NIHL risk \
assessment."}|>, <|"DB" -> {"DB" -> "PubMed"},

specific reading disability) is a specific learning disorder that has a \
neurobiological origin. It is marked by difficulties with accurate or fluent \
recognition of words and poor spelling in people who have average or above \
average intelligence and these difficulties cannot be attributed to another \
cause, for example, poor vision, hearing difficulty, or lack of \
socio-environmental opportunities, motivation, or adequate instruction. \
Studies have correlated reading skills with musical abilities. It has been \
hypothesized that musical training may be able to remediate timing \
difficulties, improve pitch perception, or increase spatial awareness, \
thereby having a positive effect on skills needed in the development of \
language and literacy. OBJECTIVES: To study the effectiveness of music \
education on reading skills (that is, oral reading skills, reading \
comprehension, reading fluency, phonological awareness, and spelling) in \
children and adolescents with dyslexia. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the \
following electronic databases in June 2012: CENTRAL (2012, Issue 5), MEDLINE \
(1948 to May Week 4 2012 ), EMBASE (1980 to 2012 Week 22), CINAHL (searched 7 \
June 2012), LILACS (searched 7 June 2012), PsycINFO (1887 to May Week 5 \
2012), ERIC (searched 7 June 2012), Arts and Humanities Citation Index (1970 \
to 6 June 2012), Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Sciences and \
Humanities (1990 to 6 June 2012), and WorldCat (searched 7 June 2012). We \
also searched the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) \
and reference lists of studies. We did not apply any date or language limits. \
SELECTION CRITERIA: We planned to include randomized controlled trials. We \
looked for studies that included at least one of our primary outcomes. The \
primary outcomes were related to the main domain of the reading: oral reading \
skills, reading comprehension, reading fluency, phonological awareness, and \
spelling, measured through validated instruments. The secondary outcomes were \
self esteem and academic achievement. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two \
authors (HCM and RBA) independently screened all titles and abstracts \
identified through the search strategy to determine their eligibility. For \
our analysis we had planned to use mean difference for continuous data, with \
95% confidence intervals, and to use the random-effects statistical model \
when the effect estimates of two or more studies could be combined in a \
meta-analysis. MAIN RESULTS: We retrieved 851 references via the search \
strategy. No randomized controlled trials testing music education for the \
improvement of reading skills in children with dyslexia could be included in \
this review. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence available from \
randomized controlled trials on which to base a judgment about the \
effectiveness of music education for the improvement of reading skills in \
children and adolescents with dyslexia. This uncertainty warrants further \
research via randomized controlled trials, involving a interdisciplinary \
team: musicians, hearing and speech therapists, psychologists, and \
physicians."}|>, <|"DB" -> {"DB" -> "PubMed"},

METHODS: Authors performed a literature review of publications related to \
musician performance-related musculoskeletal disorders (PRMDs) and \
performance-related pain (PRP), behavioral health disorders, dystonias, and \
hearing loss, published from 2004 to 2019 PubMed. RESULTS: The search \
returned 174 possible articles which, after review and exclusion, yielded 88 \
articles. CONCLUSIONS: Medical literature suggests several risk factors for \
multiple disease categories. Practice time and history of PRMD/PRP were both \
associated with development of PRMD/PRP and focal dystonia. A history of \
behavioral health disorder was associated with development of focal dystonia. \

Participants included 12 musician ( M = 60 years) and 12 nonmusician ( M = 55 \
years) adult hearing aid users with mild-moderate hearing loss, on average. \
Self-adjustments were made to hearing aid gain and compression settings for 2 \
music stimuli and a speech stimulus. Speech recognition in quiet and noise, \
sound quality for 6 dimensions (clarity, pleasantness, naturalness, fullness, \
brightness, and overall impression), and strength of preference ratings using \
paired comparisons were then assessed at both the NAL-NL2 settings and the \
participants' SA settings. Results On average, self-adjustments made by both \
groups were quite small (< 5 dB for gain and < 0.5 for compression ratio). \
Furthermore, SA changes to gain and compression ratio were not significantly \
different for musicians versus nonmusicians or for music versus speech. \
Finally, speech perception performance and sound quality ratings did not \
differ for the SA settings versus the NAL-NL2 settings, with the exception of \
the naturalness sound quality dimension. Conclusions These data suggest that \
a gain-frequency response specific to musicians and/or music inputs may not \
be necessary. Thus, current, validated prescriptive methods continue to be \
well supported as an appropriate starting place for listeners with \
mild-moderate hearing loss using open hearing aid fittings."}|>,

hearing than the general population and are at particular risk because they \
rehearse and perform daily in loud environments. Also, they engage in use of \
personal listening devices which increases the amount of \"exposure\" time. \
Despite increased risk, many do not use hearing protection devices (HPD). The \
purpose of this study was to (1) to identify the present level of education \
about hearing health, (2) identify the perceived advantages and disadvantages \
of using HPD, and (3) evaluate results among different musical instrument \
groups. METHODS: A mixed-methods group design was used including both \
quantitative and qualitative instruments. SPSS was used to generate \
descriptive statistics, and non-parametric statistical analysis was performed \
on quantitative data. NVivo software was used to evaluate qualitative \
responses. RESULTS: Of the 90 college instrumental music students who \
participated, 12% reported a history of hearing loss, and over one-third \
reported tinnitus. Seventy-seven percent of participants had never received \
any training about hearing health and only a small percentage of students \
used HPD. The most cited reason for lack of protection use was its negative \
impact on sound quality. However, group differences were noted between brass, \
woodwind, and percussion musicians in terms of HPD uptake. CONCLUSION: \
Improving the type of information disseminated to college musicians may \
reduce the risk of ear-related deficits. Noise dosage information, HPD \
information, and prevention education grounded in theories like the Health \
Belief Model may increase awareness and promote greater use of HPDs in this \
population."}|>, <|"DB" -> {"DB" -> "PubMed"},

types of inputs are being investigated and this is certainly the case for \
music. Whether the hearing aid wearer is a musician or merely someone who \
likes to listen to music, the electronic and electro-acoustic parameters \
described can be optimized for music as well as for speech. That is, a \
hearing aid optimally set for music can be optimally set for speech, even \
though the converse is not necessarily true. Similarities and differences \
between speech and music as inputs to a hearing aid are described. Many of \
these lead to the specification of a set of optimal electro-acoustic \
characteristics. Parameters such as the peak input-limiting level, \
compression issues-both compression ratio and knee-points-and number of \
channels all can deleteriously affect music perception through hearing aids. \
In other cases, it is not clear how to set other parameters such as noise \
reduction and feedback control mechanisms. Regardless of the existence of a \
\"music program,'' unless the various electro-acoustic parameters are \
available in a hearing aid, music fidelity will almost always be less than \
optimal. There are many unanswered questions and hypotheses in this area. \

The course design was informed by a critical appraisal of the literature on \
musicians' health problems and their management, existing health education \
courses for musicians, and the HPSM recommendations. It was delivered by a \
team of appropriately-qualified tutors over 5 months to 104 first-year \

beginning and end of the course. Thirty-three students who had been in their \
first year the year before the course was introduced served as a control \
group, completing the questionnaire on one occasion only. Items concerned: \
hearing and use of hearing protection; primary outcomes including perceived \
knowledge and importance of the topics taught on the course; and secondary \
outcomes including physical and psychological health and health-promoting \
behaviors. The content of the essays written by the first-year students as \

reported using hearing protection when practicing alone, although there was \
some evidence of hearing loss, tinnitus, and hyperacusis. Perceived knowledge \
of the topics on the course, and awareness of the risks to health associated \
with performing music, increased, as did self-efficacy; otherwise, there were \
negative effects on secondary outcomes, and few differences between the \

possible and should focus on tasks that promote auditory-motor interactions."}\

exposure was measured in two different groups (group 1 and group 2), which \
are divided into categories: (group 1 = five categories - junior, free, \
general a, general b, and master, and group 2 = two categories - adult and \

classification: acceptable dose (between 0 and 50%), above the action level \
(50 to 80%), uncertain dose level (80 to 100%), and above the acceptable \

conditions, no earplugs and with earplugs over time. Approximately half of \
the choir members also participated as soloists, recording Over the Rainbow \
under the same two conditions. All recordings were analyzed using long-term \
average spectra (LTAS). After participating in each recording session, the \
participants responded to a questionnaire about ability to hear self (solo \

conditions, no earplugs and with earplugs. RESULTS: LTAS results revealed \
that wearing earplugs in a choral setting caused decreased mean signal energy \
(>1\[ThinSpace]dB), resulting in less resonant singing. LTAS results also \
indicated that wearing earplugs in a solo setting had less effect on mean \
signal energy, resulting in a mean difference <1\[ThinSpace]dB in 3 of the 4 \

different instrument types (3) Do OAE have an added value in the diagnosis of \
noise induced hearing loss (NIHL) in musicians. METHODS: 241 professional \
musicians, aged between 23-64 participated. A brief medical history and the \
subjective judgment of their hearing and hearing problems were assessed. \
Musicians were subjected to an extensive audiological test battery, which \
contained testing of audiometric thresholds, loudness perception, diplacusis, \
tinnitus, speech perception in noise, and otoacoustic emissions. RESULTS: \
Most musicians could be categorized as normal hearing, but their audiograms \
show notches at 6 kHz, a frequency that is associated with NIHL. Musicians \
often complained about tinnitus and hyperacusis, while diplacusis was \
generally not reported as a problem. Tinnitus was most often localized utmost \
left and this could not be related to the instrument. It was usually \
perceived in high frequency areas, associated with NIHL. In general, \
musicians scored very well on the speech-in-noise test. The results of the \
loudness perception test were within normal limits. Otoacoustic emissions \
were more intense with better pure-tone thresholds, but due to large \
individual differences it can still not be used as an objective test for \
early detection of NIHL. CONCLUSIONS: Musicians show more noise induced \
hearing loss than could be expected on the basis of age and gender. Other \
indicators, such as complaints and prevalence of tinnitus, complaints about \
hyperacusis and prevalence of diplacusis suggest that musicians' ears are at \
risk. Continuing education about the risks of intensive sound exposure to \
musicians, with the emphasis on the possible development of tinnitus and \
hyperacusis and the need for good hearing protection is warranted."}|>,

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine patterns of exposure to loud music \

METHOD: A descriptive, observational exploratory survey design was used and \
43 participants (21 males and 22 females; mean age, 21 \[PlusMinus] 9 years) \
took part in this study. Sound level measurements were conducted to assess \
musicians' sound exposure during rehearsals and performances. All \
participants underwent the following audiological test battery at least 2 h \
before music exposure: Case history, otoscopic examination, tympanometry, \
pure tone audiometry and distortion products otoacoustic emission (DPOAE). \
RESULTS: Average noise levels recorded were 86 dBA during rehearsals and 98.7 \
dBA at performances and average durations of exposure were 240 and 10 min at \
rehearsals and performances, respectively. One out of 43 (1/43) participants \
presented with sensorineural hearing loss. Audiometric results of the \
remaining participants were normal and did not show a pattern suggestive of \
NIHL. A high proportion of participants (21/43) reported experiencing \

was a low prevalence of hearing loss amongst these musicians. However, a high \
proportion of them reported tinnitus, which could be an indication that they \
were at a high risk of NIHL from the music that they played."}|>,

high-intensity sounds, musicians may be at risk of noise-induced hearing loss \

aimed to investigate the frequency of hearing loss and use of protective \
measures among Iranian musicians. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 125 \
musicians, including 21 women (16.8%) and 104 men (83.2%), with at least five \
years of work experience were recruited. All participants underwent clinical \
and audiometric examinations. Demographic data, complaints about hearing \
loss, and information about the use of protective devices were collected \
through interviews. RESULTS: Audiometric notch in either one or both ears and \
bilateral hearing loss were present in respectively 42.4% and 19.2% of the \
participants. The history of tinnitus after performance and ear pain during \
performance was reported by 64 (51%) and 35 (28%) individuals, respectively. \
Less than 2% of the participants used hearing protection devices. \
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term exposure to loud sounds puts musicians at risk of \
hearing loss. However, due to their inadequate knowledge, most musicians \
never use protective devices to prevent damage to their auditory system."}|>,

compared to exposures obtained in early 2017 (the present study). In \
addition, audiometric thresholds obtained in early 2012 were compared to \
thresholds obtained in early 2017 (the present study). This collection of \
measurements presents an opportunity to observe the regularities in the \
patterns of exposure as well as threshold changes that may be expected in \
active orchestra musicians over a 5-year span. RESULTS: The pattern of noise \
exposure across instrument groups, which was consistent over the two time \
points, reveals highest exposures among brass, percussion/basses, and \
woodwinds. However, the average noise exposure across groups and time was \
consistently below 85 dBA, which suggests no occupational hazard. These \
observations were corroborated by audiometric thresholds, which were \
generally (a) in the normal range and (b) unchanged in the 5-year period \
between measurements. CONCLUSION: Because exposure levels were consistently \
below 85 dBA and changes in audiometric thresholds were minimal, we conclude \
that musicians experienced little-to-no risk of noise-induced hearing loss."}\

the most complex tasks faced by listeners on a daily basis. Although \
listening in noise presents challenges for all listeners, background noise \
inordinately affects speech perception in older adults and in children with \
learning disabilities. Hearing thresholds are an important factor in SIN \
perception, but they are not the only factor. For successful comprehension, \
the listener must perceive and attend to relevant speech features, such as \
the pitch, timing, and timbre of the target speaker's voice. Here, we review \
recent studies linking SIN and brainstem processing of speech sounds. \
PURPOSE: To review recent work that has examined the ability of the auditory \
brainstem response to complex sounds (cABR), which reflects the nervous \
system's transcription of pitch, timing, and timbre, to be used as an \
objective neural index for hearing-in-noise abilities. STUDY SAMPLE: We \
examined speech-evoked brainstem responses in a variety of populations, \
including children who are typically developing, children with language-based \
learning impairment, young adults, older adults, and auditory experts (i.e., \
musicians). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: In a number of studies, we recorded \
brainstem responses in quiet and babble noise conditions to the speech \
syllable /da/ in all age groups, as well as in a variable condition in \
children in which /da/ was presented in the context of seven other speech \
sounds. We also measured speech-in-noise perception using the \
Hearing-in-Noise Test (HINT) and the Quick Speech-in-Noise Test (QuickSIN). \
RESULTS: Children and adults with poor SIN perception have deficits in the \
subcortical spectrotemporal representation of speech, including low-frequency \
spectral magnitudes and the timing of transient response peaks. Furthermore, \
auditory expertise, as engendered by musical training, provides both \
behavioral and neural advantages for processing speech in noise. CONCLUSIONS: \
These results have implications for future assessment and management \
strategies for young and old populations whose primary complaint is \
difficulty hearing in background noise. The cABR provides a clinically \
applicable metric for objective assessment of individuals with SIN deficits, \
for determination of the biologic nature of disorders affecting SIN \
perception, for evaluation of appropriate hearing aid algorithms, and for \
monitoring the efficacy of auditory remediation and training."}|>,

presentation of music to the glabrous skin of the fingertip, forefoot and \
heel. No significant differences were found between the thresholds for \
sinusoids representing notes between C1 and C6 when presented to the \
fingertip of participants with normal hearing and with a severe or profound \
hearing loss. For participants with normal hearing, thresholds for notes \
between C1 and C6 showed the characteristic U-shape curve for the fingertip, \
but not for the forefoot and heel. Compared to the fingertip, the forefoot \
had lower thresholds between C1 and C3, and the heel had lower thresholds \
between C1 and G2; this is attributed to spatial summation from the Pacinian \
receptors over the larger contactor area used for the forefoot and heel. \
Participants with normal hearing assessed the perception of high-frequency \
vibration using 1s sinusoids presented to the fingertip and were found to be \
more aware of transient vibration at the beginning and/or end of notes \
between G4 and C6 when stimuli were presented 10dB above threshold, rather \
than at threshold. An average of 94% of these participants reported feeling \
continuous vibration between G4 and G5 with stimuli presented 10dB above \
threshold. Based on the experimental findings and consideration of health \
effects relating to vibration exposure, a suitable range of notes for \
vibrotactile presentation of music is identified as being from C1 to G5. This \
is more limited than for human hearing but the fundamental frequencies of the \

professional musicians in the UK. BACKGROUND: Tinnitus is the experience of \
sound when an external source is absent, primarily associated with the ageing \
process, hearing loss, and noise exposure. Amongst populations exposed to \
industrial noise, noise exposure and noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) have \
been found to be the factors most associated with tinnitus. The risk of NIHL \
amongst professional musicians is greater than that amongst the general \
population, meaning they may be at increased risk of tinnitus. METHODS: \
Seventy-four professional musicians completed an online survey involving \
closed and open-ended questions, and completed the Tinnitus fuctional Index \
(TFI) questionnaire. Descriptive statistics and thematic analysis of \
open-ended qualitative responses were used to analyse the data. RESULTS: \
Three themes were generated from the analysis of the responses to the \
open-ended questions. These themes were: (1) the impact of tinnitus on the \
lives of professional musicians, (2) professional musician experience of \
tinnitus services, support, and hearing health and safety, and (3) the \
support professional musicians want. The mean global TFI score for \
professional musicians was 39.05, interpreted as tinnitus being a moderate \
problem. Comparisons with general population data revealed lower TFI scores \
for the TFI subscales of 'sense of control' and 'intrusiveness' for \
professional musicians and higher for auditory difficulties associated with \
tinnitus amongst professional musicians. CONCLUSION: Tinnitus can negatively \
impact on professional musicians' lives. There is a need for bespoke \
self-help groups, awareness raising, and education to prevent tinnitus and \
promote hearing health among musicians."}|>, <|"DB" -> {"DB" -> "PubMed"},

Hearing Handicap Index (MHHI), a new self-evaluation tool for quantifying \
occupation-related auditory difficulties in music professionals. Although \
pure-tone audiometry is often considered the \"gold standard\" and is usually \
employed as the main instrument for hearing assessment, it cannot fully \
describe the impact of hearing dysfunction. The MHHI is an attempt to \
complement the hearing impairment assessment toolbox and is based on a unique \
approach to quantify the effects of hearing-related symptoms or hearing loss \
on the performance of musicians and other music industry professionals. \
Method An initial set of 143 questionnaire items was successively refined \
through a series of critical appraisals, modifications, and suggestions. This \
yielded an intermediate questionnaire consisting of 43 items, which was \
administered to 204 musicians and sound engineers. After exploratory factor \
analysis, the final form of the MHHI questionnaire was obtained, consisting \
of 29 items. The questionnaire's test-retest reliability, internal \
consistency, discriminating power, content validity, criterion validity, and \
aspects of construct validity and inherent conceptual structure were \
assessed. Results Exploratory factor analysis revealed a combination of four \
common factors for the 29 validated questionnaire items. They were named \
\"impact on social and working lives,\" \"difficulties in performance and \
sound perception,\" \"communication difficulties,\" and \"emotional \
distress.\" The MHHI was shown to be a valid and reliable instrument to \
assess musicians' and sound engineers' occupational difficulties due to \
hearing impairment and related symptoms. Conclusion The ability of the MHHI \
to discriminate between groups of music professionals with different auditory \
symptoms or pure-tone audiometry thresholds suggests that auditory symptoms \
might influence a professional's performance to an extent that cannot be \
assessed by a pure-tone audiogram."}|>, <|"DB" -> {"DB" -> "PubMed"},

   "AB" -> {"AB" -> "BACKGROUND: Hearing aids (HAs) are important for the \
rehabilitation of individuals with hearing loss. Although the rehabilitation \
of speech communication is well understood, less attention has been devoted \
to understanding hearing-impaired instrumentalists' needs to actively \
participate in music. Despite efforts to adjust HA settings for music \
acoustics, there lacks an understanding of instrumentalists' needs and if \
those HA adjustments satisfy their needs. PURPOSE: The purpose of the current \
study was to explore the challenges that adult HA-wearing instrumentalists \
face, which prevent them from listening, responding to, and performing music. \
RESEARCH DESIGN: A qualitative methodology was employed with the use of \
semistructured interviews conducted with adult amateur instrumentalists. \
STUDY SAMPLE: Twelve HA users who were amateur ensemble instrumentalists \
(playing instruments from the percussion, wind, reed, brass, and string \
families) and between the ages of 55 and 83 years (seven men and five women) \
provided data for analysis in this study. Amateur in this context was defined \
as one who engaged mindfully in pursuit of an activity. DATA COLLECTION AND \
ANALYSIS: Semistructured interviews were conducted using an open-ended \
interview guide. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. \
Transcripts were analyzed using conventional qualitative content analysis. \
RESULTS: Three categories emerged from the data: (1) participatory needs, (2) \
effects of HA use, and (3) effects of hearing loss. Participants primarily \
used HAs to hear the conductor's instructions to meaningfully participate in \
music rehearsals. Effects of HA use fell within two subcategories: HA music \
sound quality and use of an HA music program. The effects of hearing loss \
fell within three subcategories: inability to identify missing information, \
affected music components, and nonauditory music perception strategies. \
CONCLUSIONS: Not surprisingly, hearing-impaired instrumentalists face \
challenges participating in their music activities. However, although \
participants articulated ways in which HAs and hearing loss affect music \
perception, which in turn revealed perspectives toward listening using the \
auditory system and other sensory systems, the primary motivation for their \
HA use was the need to hear the conductor's directions. These findings \
suggest that providing hearing-impaired instrumentalists access to musical \
experience via participation should be prioritized above restoring the \
perception of musical descriptors. Future research is needed with \
instrumentalists who no longer listen to or perform music because of hearing \
loss, so that the relationship between musical auditory deficiencies and \
participation can be better explored."}|>, <|"DB" -> {"DB" -> "PubMed"},

MATERIAL: A questionnaire on the use of protective hearing devices, hearing \
care, and subjective judgments of hearing difficulties was completed by a \
group of classical musicians from Spain. We analysed the frequency of device \
use by instrument based on contingency tables analysed by \[Chi](2) tests. \
RESULTS: One hundred and ninety-four Spanish classical orchestral musicians \
voluntarily completed the questionnaire. The percentage of musicians who \
reported using hearing protection in our survey was very low and varied with \
the type of instrument played. However, we found a high prevalence of \
subjective auditory disorders within this group. CONCLUSION: Few Spanish \
musicians use hearing protection. Training on hearing-loss prevention in this \

to improved fundamental frequency (F(0)) discrimination for young listeners \
with normal hearing (NH). It is unclear whether a comparable effect of \
musical training occurs for listeners whose sensory encoding of F(0) is \
degraded. To address this question, the effect of musical training was \
investigated for three groups of listeners (young NH, older NH, and older \
listeners with hearing impairment, HI). In a first experiment, F(0) \
discrimination was investigated using complex tones that differed in harmonic \
content and phase configuration (sine, positive, or negative Schroeder). \
Musical training was associated with significantly better F(0) discrimination \
of complex tones containing low-numbered harmonics for all groups of \
listeners. Part of this effect was caused by the fact that musicians were \
more robust than non-musicians to harmonic roving. Despite the benefit \
relative to their non-musicians counterparts, the older musicians, with or \
without HI, performed worse than the young musicians. In a second experiment, \
binaural sensitivity to temporal fine structure (TFS) cues was assessed for \
the same listeners by estimating the highest frequency at which an interaural \
phase difference was perceived. Performance was better for musicians for all \
groups of listeners and the use of TFS cues was degraded for the two older \
groups of listeners. These findings suggest that musical training is \
associated with an enhancement of both TFS cues encoding and F(0) \
discrimination in young and older listeners with or without HI, although the \
musicians' benefit decreased with increasing hearing loss. Additionally, \
models of the auditory periphery and midbrain were used to examine the effect \
of HI on F(0) encoding. The model predictions reflected the worsening in F(0) \
discrimination with increasing HI and accounted for up to \
80\[NonBreakingSpace]% of the variance in the data."}|>,

familiar orchestral musicians were with the various insertable models of \
hearing protectors. The present study focuses on musicians and entertainers \
and proposes the maintenance of a noise exposure limit through the use of a \
hearing protector. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was conducted by \
distributing a questionnaire to musicians ( n = 429) in nine orchestras in \
order to obtain information on the use of hearing protection and the \
musicians' hearing sensitivity. RESULTS: Hearing protectors were found to be \
seldom used by orchestral musicians. During orchestral rehearsals, < 1/6 of \
the test persons used Type 1 (individually fitted) hearing protectors \
although> 80% of the respondents indicated that they knew about them. A gap \
emerged between what seemed most important to musicians in hearing protectors \
and what was provided by the manufacturers. CONCLUSIONS: The subject of \
hearing protection in orchestral musicians should be investigated with a \
multidimensional approach which considers the following in equal measure: \
legal regulations, the requirements and limits of the music sector and the \
individual characteristics of the musicians involved."}|>,

problems to their players. Based on reviews of the literature and personal \

musicians who play instruments in the bassoon family (including the bassoon, \
contrabassoon, and several other instruments). Prevalence rates are higher in \
reports of surveys (ranging up to 86%), compared to clinical reports of \
patients seen and treated. Significant risk factors include young age, small \
body size, female gender, and use of large instruments. Problems unique to \
bassoonists are rare; most physical difficulties also are seen in general \
musculoskeletal clinical practices and in musicians playing all types of \
instruments. The left upper extremity is more commonly affected by \
overuse-related conditions in bassoonists. Non-playing-related problems are \
equally important for consideration (such as degenerative disorders and acute \
trauma), since they also affect practice and performance. Little experimental \
data exist to validate current and widely-held principles of treatment, \
rehabilitation, and prevention."}|>, <|"DB" -> {"DB" -> "PubMed"},

loss (NIHL) in university marching band members and to provide an overview of \
a hearing conservation program for a marching band. METHOD: Sound levels \
during band rehearsals were recorded and audiometric hearing thresholds and \
transient otoacoustic emission were measured over a 3-year period. Musician's \
earplugs and information about hearing loss were provided to the students. \
The hearing thresholds of other college students were tested as a partial \
control. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in hearing thresholds \
between the two groups. During initial testing, more marching band members \
showed apparent high-frequency notches than control students. Follow-up \
hearing tests in a subsequent year for the marching band members showed that \
almost all notches disappeared. Persistent standard threshold shift (STS) \
across tests was not observed in the band members. CONCLUSION: Band members \
showed no evidence of STS or persistent notched audiograms. Because accepted \
procedures for measuring hearing showed a lack of precision in reliably \
detecting early NIHL in marching band members, it is recommended that signs \
of NIHL be sought in repeated measurements compared to baseline audiograms \
rather than in a single measure (a single notch). A hearing conservation \
program for this population is still recommended because of lengthy rehearsal \
times with high sound-level exposure during rehearsals."}|>,

of music students in relation to their exposure to excessive sounds. MATERIAL \
AND METHODS: Standard pure-tone audiometry (PTA) was performed in 168 music \
students, aged 22.5\[PlusMinus]2.5 years. The control group included 67 \
subjects, non-music students and non-musicians, aged 22.8\[PlusMinus]3.3 \
years. Data on the study subjects' musical experience, instruments in use, \
time of weekly practice and additional risk factors for noise-induced hearing \
loss (NIHL) were identified by means of a questionnaire survey. Sound \
pressure levels produced by various groups of instruments during solo and \
group playing were also measured and analyzed. The music students' \
audiometric hearing threshold levels (HTLs) were compared with the \
theoretical predictions calculated according to the International \
Organization for Standardization standard ISO 1999:2013. RESULTS: It was \
estimated that the music students were exposed for 27.1\[PlusMinus]14.3 \
h/week to sounds at the A-weighted equivalent-continuous sound pressure level \
of 89.9\[PlusMinus]6.0 dB. There were no significant differences in HTLs \
between the music students and the control group in the frequency range of \
4000-8000 Hz. Furthermore, in each group HTLs in the frequency range \
1000-8000 Hz did not exceed 20 dB HL in 83% of the examined ears. \
Nevertheless, high frequency notched audiograms typical of the noise-induced \
hearing loss were found in 13.4% and 9% of the musicians and non-musicians, \
respectively. The odds ratio (OR) of notching in the music students increased \
significantly along with higher sound pressure levels (OR = 1.07, 95% \
confidence interval (CI): 1.014-1.13, p < 0.05). The students' HTLs were \
worse (higher) than those of a highly screened non-noise-exposed population. \
Moreover, their hearing loss was less severe than that expected from sound \
exposure for frequencies of 3000 Hz and 4000 Hz, and it was more severe in \
the case of frequency of 6000 Hz. CONCLUSIONS: The results confirm the need \
for further studies and development of a hearing conservation program for \
music students. Int J Occup Med Environ Health 2017;30(1):55-75."}|>,

value of cortical auditory evoked potentials (CAEPs) evoked in response to \
auditory change stimuli, known as acoustic change complexes (ACCs), as an \
objective measurement of auditory performance in hearing impairment. \
Secondary objectives were to assess the effect of hearing loss and \
non-professional musical experience on the ACC, and compare the ACC to the \
'conventional' CAEP evoked in response to stimulus onset. In 24 \
normal-hearing subjects, consisting of 12 musicians and 12 non-musicians, and \
13 age-matched hearing-impaired subjects ACCs were recorded in response to \
12% frequency increases at four base frequencies (0.5, 1, 2 and \
4\[NonBreakingSpace]kHz). ACC amplitudes and latencies were compared to \
frequency discrimination thresholds at each base frequency, and to speech \
perception in noise. Frequency discrimination and speech perception in noise \
were significantly better for larger ACC N1-P2 amplitudes and shorter N1 \
latencies, whereas both frequency discrimination and speech perception did \
not correlate with onset CAEP amplitude or latency. Multiple regression \
analysis for prediction of speech perception in noise revealed that the \
strongest model was obtained by averaging over three frequencies (1, 2 and \
4\[NonBreakingSpace]kHz) with two significant predictors: hearing loss \
(R(2)\[NonBreakingSpace]=\[NonBreakingSpace]0.52) and ACC latency \
(R(2)\[NonBreakingSpace]=\[NonBreakingSpace]0.35). Thus, explaining 87% of \
the variance, this model indicates that subjects with longer ACC latencies \
have worse speech perception in noise than subjects with comparable hearing \
thresholds and shorter ACC latencies. If hearing loss was removed from this \
model, the combination of ACC amplitude and latency over those three \
frequencies explained 74% of the total variance in speech perception in \
noise. There were no differences in frequency discrimination, speech \
perception, CAEP, or ACC between recreational musicians and non-musicians. We \
conclude that the objective ACC N1 latency is a good predictor of speech \
perception in noise. When confirmed in validation studies with larger numbers \
of subjects, it can aid clinicians in their evaluation of auditory \
performance and higher order processing, in particular when behavioral \

loss between groups of British Army musicians and with their administrative \
(non-musician) counterparts. METHODS: Routine health surveillance audiometric \
data for a group of military musicians were compared with military \
administrative staff during the first 8-12 years of their careers. Structured \
interviews were used to identify those meeting the study inclusion criteria \
(8 year minimum service, no significant, relevant medical history, no \
previous extraordinary loud noise exposure, service within study employment \
group throughout military career), and to clarify the instrument played. \
RESULTS: Eighty-four musicians and 44 administrators participated. Using the \
Health & Safety Executive's (HSE's) age- and gender-correcting system, 12 \
(14%) musicians and 9 (20%) non-musicians had a deterioration in hearing. The \
overall odds ratio for developing hearing loss in musicians was 0.65 (95% CI \
0.25-1.68). Compared with woodwind instrumentalists, the odds ratio for \
hearing loss in brass instrumentalists was 2.00 (95% CI 0.85-3.44) and for \
percussionists 1.83 (95% CI 0.77-2.90). CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest \
that military musicians are at no greater risk of hearing loss than their \
administrative counterparts after 8-12 years in service. This may represent a \
healthy-worker effect. There is no statistically significant differential \
risk of hearing loss between different instrumental groups."}|>,

conventional audiometry, 92.85% had hearing thresholds within normal limits; \

as a musical instrument in both popular and classical music which can induce \
a percussive sound at low frequencies (146-290 Hz) with peaks of up to 130 \
dBspl. The percussive sounds have a power distribution in the region of \
saccular sensitivity. In view of the saccular stimulation by sound in humans, \
we decided to use cervical vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials (cVEMPs) to \
evaluate the possibility that the daf music may have a disturbing effect on \
saccular function. MATERIALS AND METHODS: During this case-control study, 18 \
daf musicians were compared with 20 healthy individuals evaluated in the \
audiology department of the Hamadan University of Medical Sciences. \
Assessment consisted of pure tone audiometry, tympanometry, and cVEMPs. \
RESULTS: Multiple comparisons of mean the cVEMPs and mean hearing loss at 250 \
Hz among the three groups (affected, unaffected, and normal ears) were \
significant. There were no significant differences between all daf players on \
high-tone loss at 3000 Hz. The daf musicians had bilateral unsymmetrical \
sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), with hearing loss at 250 Hz (low-tone \
loss) and notched audiogram at 3000 Hz (high-tone loss). Eleven musicians \
with decreased vestibular excitability as detected by abnormal cVEMPs had \
mild (26-40 dBHL) low-tone loss and significant abnormal cVEMPs findings. In \
contrast, the others had slight (16-25 dBHL) low-tone loss with normal \

in professional musicians with that in the general population. METHODS: We \
performed a historical cohort study among insurants between 19 and \
66\[ThickSpace]years who were employed subject to social insurance \
contributions. The study was conducted with data from three German statutory \
health insurance providers covering the years 2004-2008 with about 7 million \

noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL), conductive HL, sensorineural HL, \
conductive and sensorineural HL, as well as tinnitus were estimated \
stratified by age, sex and federal state. A Cox regression analysis was \

there has been a great deal of research into this area in terms of the \

relatively few industry-specific strategies that can be adopted by an \
orchestra looking to address these issues. Australia does not have a uniform \
approach to hearing conservation management in its orchestras; however, each \
orchestra actively grapples with the challenges of balancing legal, \
practical, and artistic concerns. This study systematically investigated \
hearing conservation practices, noise exposure management, and audiological \

personal interviews with staff at each orchestra, including inspection of \
venues and facilities. While all these orchestras were aware of the risks and \
were actively taking significant steps to reduce noise exposure, a range of \
approaches, with varying degrees of effectiveness and understanding of the \
issue, were found across the sector. There was limited evidence of \
educational programs for either the musicians at risk of excessive noise \
exposure or the staff responsible for devising and implementing control \
measures. In addition, the reported use of adequate personal hearing \
protection by musicians was poor. As Australia has recently introduced a \
national approach to workplace health and safety, a similar approach to noise \

musical training. Speech perception (word recognition in competing message; \
Northwestern University Auditory Test Number 6), cognitive function \
(cognitive test battery), and impairment (self-report or surrogate report of \
Alzheimer's disease or dementia, and/or a Mini-Mental State Examination score \

included 2,938 Epidemiology of Hearing Loss Study participants who had \
musical training data and at least one follow-up of speech perception and/or \
cognitive assessment. We used linear mixed-effects models to determine \
associations between musicianship and decline in speech perception and \
cognitive function over time and Cox regression models to evaluate \
associations of musical training with 20-year cumulative incidence of speech \
perception and cognitive impairment. Models were adjusted for age, sex, and \
occupation and repeated with additional adjustment for health-related \
confounders and education. Results Musicians showed less speech perception \
decline over time with stronger effects in women (0.16% difference, 95% \
confidence interval [CI] [0.05, 0.26]). Among men, musicians had, on average, \
better speech perception than nonmusicians (3.41% difference, 95% CI [0.62, \
6.20]) and were less likely to develop a cognitive impairment than \
nonmusicians (hazard ratio = 0.58, 95% CI [0.37, 0.91]). Conclusions \
Musicians showed an advantage in speech perception abilities and cognition \
later in life and less decline over time with different magnitudes of effect \
sizes in men and women. Associations remained with further adjustment, \
indicating that some degree of the advantage of musical training is \
independent of socioeconomic or health differences. If confirmed, these \
findings could have implications for developing speech perception \

estimate the hearing status of classical symphony orchestra musicians and (2) \
investigate the hypothesis that occupational sound exposure of symphony \
orchestra musicians leads to elevated hearing thresholds. DESIGN: The study \
population comprised all the musicians from five symphony orchestras. \
Questionnaires were filled in by 337 subjects, and 212 subjects performed an \
audiometric test. For a group of 182 musicians (363 ears) the results of the \
audiometry was analyzed in relation to the individual exposure, which was \
estimated on the basis of sound measurements and questionnaire data regarding \
the exposure time. The mean hearing threshold at the frequencies 3, 4, and 6 \
kHz, corrected for age and sex, was used as outcome. RESULTS: The musician \
ears with the highest exposure (29 of 363) had an additional threshold shift \
of 6.3 dB compared with the 238 ears with lowest exposure. The observed \
hearing loss of musicians was smaller compared with the noise-induced \
permanent threshold shift (NIPTS) predicted from ISO1999. A remaining \
confounding effect of age after ISO7029 age corrections could be observed to \
explain the difference in observed and predicted NIPTS. However, the observed \
hearing loss difference between the left and the right ear of musicians was \
2.5 dB (95% confidence interval 1.5-3.6), which was similar to the NIPTS \
predicted from ISO1999. Most of the musicians had better hearing at 3, 4, and \
6 kHz for age than expected, however, 29 ears with the highest exposure above \
90.4 dBA with a mean exposure time of 41.7 years had significantly elevated \
hearing thresholds. Trumpet players and the left ear of first violinists had \
significantly elevated hearing thresholds compared with other musicians. \
CONCLUSION: Most of the symphony orchestra musicians had better hearing than \
expected but they had a work-related risk of developing additional \
noise-induced hearing loss. The additional NITPS of the left ear compared \
with the right ear was at the expected level based on the cumulated sound \
exposure and ISO1999, indicating that performing music may induce hearing \
loss to the same extent as industrial noise."}|>,

environment with high sound exposure levels above the international \
standards. Aim of the current study is to find out, whether they develop the \
expected hearing impairments. Adherence to the regulations for prevention in \
musicians is more difficult than in other occupational fields. METHODS: In an \
interval of 13.3\[NonBreakingSpace]years, 36 out of 58 male military \
musicians of a German army music corps were subjected twice to an audiometric \
audit. There were no exclusion criteria apart from acute ENT infections \
(three musicians). These results were compared with one another and evaluated \
by means of statistical methods for relationships with several factors. \
RESULTS: At frequencies below 3\[NonBreakingSpace]kHz, the follow-up \
audiograms were up to 5\[NonBreakingSpace]dB better than the preliminary \
examination. From 4\[NonBreakingSpace]kHz up to 8\[NonBreakingSpace]kHz the \
preliminary investigations showed less hearing impairment. Averaging all \
frequencies the improvement of hearing ability was around \
1\[NonBreakingSpace]dB. Above 1\[NonBreakingSpace]kHz the average hearing of \
the right ear was up to 7\[NonBreakingSpace]dB better than that of the left \
ear. Age-induced hearing loss was 3 to 8\[NonBreakingSpace]dB lower than \
predicted by ISO standards over the entire frequency range. The side of the \
ear (right/left) and the frequency (3, 4, and 6\[NonBreakingSpace]kHz) were \
significant (p\[NonBreakingSpace]<\[ThinSpace]0.05) in hearing loss, whereas \
the influence of the instrument and the acoustic traumata were not. \
CONCLUSION: Despite the high noise levels, the average hearing ability of the \
36 military musicians during the investigation period only slightly \
deteriorated in the noise-sensitive frequencies (3, 5 and \
6\[NonBreakingSpace]kHz). Music may be less harmful than industrial noise, or \

in this subcortical response, cABRs can be used to assess specific \
impairments and enhancements in auditory processing. Notably, subcortical \
auditory function is neither passive nor hardwired but dynamically interacts \
with higher-level cognitive processes to refine how sounds are transcribed \
into neural code. This experience-dependent plasticity, which can occur on a \
number of time scales (e.g., life-long experience with speech or music, \
short-term auditory training, on-line auditory processing), helps shape \
sensory perception. Thus, by being an objective and noninvasive means for \

musicians selected at random. A control group was included at random for \
comparison. STUDY SAMPLE: We recruited 111 musicians and a control group of \
40 non-musicians. Testing was conducted by using clinical examination, pure \
tone audiometry, TEOAEs and a questionnaire. RESULTS: TEOAE SNR in the \
half-octave frequency band centred on 4\[ThinSpace]kHz was significantly \
lower bilaterally in musicians than controls. This effect was strongly \
predicted by age and pure-tone hearing threshold levels in the \
3-6\[ThinSpace]kHz range. Bilateral hearing thresholds were significantly \
higher at 6\[ThinSpace]kHz in musicians. Twenty percent of the musicians had \
permanent tinnitus. There was no association between the TEOAE parameters and \
permanent tinnitus. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest an incipient hearing \
loss at 6\[ThinSpace]kHz in rock musicians. Loss of TEOAE SNR in the \
4\[ThinSpace]kHz half-octave frequency band was observed, but it was related \
to higher mean 3-6\[ThinSpace]kHz hearing thresholds and age. A large \

developing hearing sensitivity and hearing-related problems given their \
occupational exposure to high-level sound. Among options for hearing \
conservation, earplugs are an effective and inexpensive choice. Adoption \
rates for musicians' earplugs remains consistently low, however, given \
concerns about the impact of hearing protection on their own performance as \
well as concerns that the resultant music will be a negative experience for \
listeners. In fact, few studies have (1) examined musicians' attitudes about \
using hearing protection while performing themselves and (2) determined \
whether music played by musicians wearing hearing protection sounds different \
to listeners. PURPOSE: The purposes of this study were (1) to evaluate how \
wearing musicians' earplugs affected musicians' perception of their \
performance while they were playing, and (2) to examine whether listeners can \
distinguish a difference between music recorded by musicians playing with and \
without earplugs. RESEARCH DESIGN: Experiment 1: student musicians were \
recorded playing under two conditions (with and without wearing earplugs) and \
then were surveyed about their experience. Experiment 2: musically \
experienced and na\[IDoubleDot]ve listeners were presented with musical \
samples played by musicians with and without earplugs in an ABX format. \
Listeners responded by indicating whether the third stimulus (X) was \
conditionally identical to the first (A) or second stimulus (B). RESULTS: \
Experiment 1: while performing, musicians always preferred the no earplugs \
condition. The majority, however, rated the overall experience of playing \
with earplugs as generally positive. Experiment 2: listeners were unable to \
hear a difference between the two recordings. DISCUSSION: In this experiment, \
musicians rated their experience playing without hearing protection more \
favorably than their experience playing with hearing protection, but most \
musicians rated their experience with hearing protection as generally \
positive. The inability of listeners to distinguish a difference in music \
played with and without hearing protection suggests that the listening \
experience may not be adversely impacted by hearing protection worn by the \
performers. CONCLUSION: Earplugs are an inexpensive, noninvasive strategy for \
hearing conservation for musicians, and this study indicates that barriers to \
wearing hearing protection might be less problematic than previously \
reported."}|>, <|"DB" -> {"DB" -> "PubMed"},

not different in musicians with and without tinnitus. Tinnitus-affected \

cannot be reliably objectified by conventional audiometric methods. Moreover, \
the fact that a PEU is affected by an ear disease may influence treatment \

foam earplugs and both non-custom and custom versions of uniform attenuation \
earplugs (UAEs) marketed to musicians. DESIGN: A mixed-methods approach was \
used to evaluate the HPDs. Audiometric testing obtained hearing levels at \
baseline and with each HPD across frequencies (125-8000\[ThinSpace]Hz) to \
determine personal attenuation ratings and uniformity of attenuation. \
Participants completed surveys over six months regarding how often they used \
the HPDs and their perceptions about wearing them. STUDY SAMPLE: Twenty-four \
musicians were recruited to participate. RESULTS: Substantial variability was \
observed in the attenuation achieved among participants for each HPD type, \
but custom UAEs provided the most consistent attenuation across frequencies. \
Participants' HPD preferences were influenced by multiple factors including \
personal instrument and specific activity. Custom UAEs were most frequently \
used but usage rates continually decreased over the 6-month period. \
CONCLUSIONS: Fit-testing is important to determine fit and sizing. Combining \
information on the effectiveness of HPDs with musicians' opinions about \
wearing them can inform recommendations for which types may be the most \

while using earplugs thus reducing the effectiveness of the hearing \
protection offered by earplugs. In addition, the dynamic range (DR) of the \

perceived quality of music. There are some cultural differences in attitudes \
toward loudness, which may lead to differences in the loudness of music \
played by musicians from different cultures. PURPOSE: To investigate the \
effect of the use of two different types of earplugs on the loudness and DR \
of music played by musicians of Caucasian and Filipino origins. RESEARCH \
DESIGN: Quasi-experimental repeated measures design. STUDY SAMPLE: Thirty six \
musicians with normal hearing within the age range of 18-49 yr. Fifteen were \
of Caucasian (eight men and 7 women) origin and 21 were of the Filipino (nine \
men and 12 women) origin. INTERVENTION: All participants received a brief \
educational session, which included information on music-induced hearing \
loss, the benefit of using earplugs, and the correct procedures for inserting \
and removing earplugs. They played music in five different conditions (three \
min each): Trial 1 of conventional and musicians' earplugs in random order, \
no earplug, and trial 2 of conventional and musicians' earplugs in random \
order. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Maximum, minimum, average (average sound \
level measured over the measurement period; LAVG), and peak levels were \
recorded using a dosimeter while playing music in each of the five \
conditions. The DR was derived by subtracting the minimum values from the \
maximum values. A different measure of the dynamic range 2 (DR2) was derived \
by subtracting the LAVG value from the peak value. Mixed analyses of variance \
(ANOVA) (Cultural origin and Gender as nonrepeated variables) was performed \
on LAVG, DR, and DR2. RESULTS: Based on the LAVG levels yielded by them, \
42-61% of the musicians may be at risk for hearing loss. The mixed ANOVA \
revealed some main effects of culture and some significant interactions \
involving cultural origin, the plug conditions, type of earplugs, and trial \
number. CONCLUSIONS: Use of earplugs may vary the overall loudness of music, \
the DR, or the DR2 in some musicians depending on the type of earplugs and \
cultural origin, and the effect may change with practice."}|>,

rheologic therapy between 1994 and 1997 due to a music related acoustic \
trauma. The type, intensity, and length of music exposure as well as the \
distance and the position to the source of noise were examined. The type of \
hearing damage and its development during rheological treatment was studied \
by pure-tone audiometry. RESULTS: In the majority of examined patients (67%) \
the hearing loss developed on the basis of one-time exposure at a rock \
concert or pop concert, followed by hearing loss from attending discotheques \
(17%) or parties (12%), and music exposure from personal cassette players \
(4%). The majority of patients showed a maximum hearing loss of 40-60 dB (A) \
in a frequency between 3 kHz and 4 kHz. Pure-tone audiometry in 58% of the \
patients exhibited a unilateral threshold in a frequency between 3 kHz and 4 \
kHz combined with ipsilateral tinnitus of the same frequency. Twenty-one \
percent of the patients showed a symmetric bilateral threshold and tinnitus \
between 3 kHz and 4 kHz. In 8% there was a unilateral tinnitus, and in 13% a \
bilateral tinnitus without any hearing loss. All patients improved their \
hearing loss during rheologic treatment. Improvement in the tinnitus was only \
achieved in 33% of the examined cases. CONCLUSION: The risk of permanent \
hearing loss resulting from short-term exposure to amplified music is low \

loud sounds. The symptoms were analyzed in relation to gender, musical \
instrument, and time of experience using statistical tests such as the \

most frequent symptom among musicians, especially among those who play \
amplified instruments. There was an association between tinnitus and hearing \
difficulty, and between instrument experience time and intolerance to loud \
sounds. The proportion of musicians with occasional tinnitus was high among \
those with less than 15 years of musical practice, and 4.53 times more \

that affects almost 10% of US adults. Research suggests that college students \
are vulnerable to tinnitus and hearing loss as they are exposed to traumatic \
levels of noise on a regular basis. Tinnitus and its influence in daily \
living continue to be underappreciated in the college-aged population. \
Therefore, the objective for the present study was to analyze prevalence and \
associated risk factors of tinnitus and tinnitus-related handicap in a sample \
of college-aged students. DESIGN: A survey was administered to 678 students \
aged 18-30 years in a cross-section of randomly selected university classes. \
The survey was adopted from the National Health and Nutrition Examination \
Survey (2010). It inquired about demographic details, medical and \
audiological history, routine noise exposure, smoking, sound level tolerance, \
tinnitus, and tinnitus-related handicap in daily living. Tinnitus-related \
handicap was assessed by the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI). Participants \
were divided into four groups: chronic tinnitus (bothersome tinnitus for >1 \
year), acute tinnitus (bothersome tinnitus for \[LessEqual]1 year), subacute \
tinnitus (at least one experience of tinnitus in a lifetime), and no tinnitus \
(no experience of tinnitus in a lifetime). RESULTS: The prevalence of \
chronic, acute, subacute, and no tinnitus was 8.4%, 13.0%, 37.9%, and 40.7% \
respectively. Almost 9% of subjects with any form of tinnitus reported more \
than a slight tinnitus-related handicap (i.e., THI score \[GreaterEqual]18). \
A multinomial regression analysis revealed that individuals with high noise \
exposure, high sound level tolerance score, recurring ear infections, and \
self-reported hearing loss had high odds of chronic tinnitus. Females showed \
higher prevalence of acute tinnitus than males. Individuals with European \
American ethnicity and smoking history showed high odds of reporting subacute \
tinnitus. Almost 10% of the subjects reported that they were music students. \
The prevalence of chronic, acute, and subacute tinnitus was 11.3%, 22.5%, and \
32.4%, respectively, for musicians, which was significantly higher than that \
for nonmusicians. Music exposure, firearm noise exposure, and occupational \
noise exposure were significantly correlated with tinnitus. Temporal \
characteristics of tinnitus, self-reported tinnitus loudness, and sound level \
tolerance were identified as major predictors for the overall THI score. \
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the reluctance to complain about tinnitus, a substantial \
portion of college-aged individuals reported tinnitus experience and its \
adverse influence in daily living. It was concluded that environmental and \
health-related factors can trigger tinnitus perception, while self-reported \
psychoacoustic descriptors of tinnitus may explain perceived tinnitus-related \
handicap in daily living by college-aged individuals. Future research is \
required to explore effects of tinnitus on educational achievements, social \
interaction, and vocational aspects of college students."}|>,

association between candidate genetic variants and audiometric measures of \
noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) in young musicians. METHODS: The study \
analyzed a database by Phillips et al. (Feasibility of a bilateral 4000-6000 \
Hz notch as a phenotype for genetic association analysis. Int J Audiol \
2015;54:645-52.) which included behavioral hearing thresholds, \
distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE), tympanometric, and genetic \
data of 166 participants meeting the inclusion criteria. Nineteen single \
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 13 cochlear genes previously associated \
with NIHL in factory workers were included in the present investigation. The \
average hearing threshold at 3000 and 4000\[VeryThinSpace]Hz (AHT) and \
average DPOAE signal to noise ratio (DPOAE SNR) in both ears were calculated. \
RESULTS: The regression analyses showed that two SNPs- one in KCNE1 \
(rs2070358) and the other in CAT (rs12273124) revealed a statistically \
significant relationship with DPOAE SNR in both ears. Two SNPs in MYH14 and \
one in GJB4 revealed a significant association with DPOAE SNR in the left \
ear. Two SNPs in HSP70, one in CDH23 and one in KCNJ10 showed significant \
association with DPOAE SNR in the right ear. None of the included SNPs showed \
association with AHT in both ears. CONCLUSIONS: A genetic variant in KCNE1 \
was associated with the strength of the cochlear amplifier as assessed by \
DPOAE SNR. Musicians carrying causal genetic variants to NIHL might exhibit \
changes in their auditory functions early in the lifespan even when most \
subjects had their hearing thresholds within normal limits. These \
participants are likely to show the clinical manifestation of NIHL in the \
future if no preventive measures are applied."}|>,

musician's earplugs (ER-15) among 15 symphony orchestra musicians with a \

a Real-Ear Attenuation at Threshold (REAT) procedure in a sound field. \
Earplug use was found to be low, and the musicians reported that earplugs \
hampered listening to their own and their colleagues' playing; earplugs \
affected either timbre or dynamics, or both. Additionally, several reasons \
related to discomfort of use were itemized, but the musicians who \
consistently used their earplugs did so in spite of problems with use. The \
REAT values obtained in sound field were relatively close to the \
manufacturer's nominal specifications, being 13.7 dB, on average. In the \
frequency range studied (0.125-8 kHz), individual variation in REAT was, \
however, up to 15 dB across the measured frequencies. Fluctuation in \
attenuation might be related to low use of hearing protectors, and REAT \
measured at fixed center frequencies may be too robust a method to uncover \
it. We therefore tested 10 additional subjects to find out whether a sweeping \

The risk of hearing loss is a concern for musicians, but some are reluctant \
to wear hearing protection due to factors such as an inability to hear their \
own instrument properly and the possibility of decreased sound quality for \
listeners. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the effect \
of musicians' earplugs on instrumental pitch accuracy and the perception of \
tone quality, intonation, and dynamic contrast, as perceived by musicians and \
listeners. METHODS: Ten university studio faculty teachers were recorded \
performing single pitches and lyrical and technical passages, first without \
earplugs and then immediately after with earplugs. A sample of 8 studio \
faculty teachers and 88 undergraduate music education students completed a \
researcher-created music perception test of tone quality, intonation, and \
dynamic contrast. RESULTS: Objective analyses of the single pitch recordings \
made by faculty with and without earplugs indicate that pitch accuracy did \
not favor either condition consistently. Results from the perception test \
indicate that although both faculty and student listeners perceived some \
differences, the most frequent perception was that the audio pair was equal, \
and there was no clear difference between performing with and without \
earplugs in terms of tone quality, intonation, or dynamic contrast. \
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that musicians should feel confident that \
wearing musicians' earplugs while performing does not adversely affect pitch \
accuracy or listeners' perceptions of their timbre and dynamic control."}|>,

prostheses designed to support spoken communication in persons with severe to \

representation of pitch and timbre, essential components of music. Not \
surprisingly, most CI users achieve significantly poorer perception and \
enjoyment of music compared with normal hearing listeners. Anecdotal evidence \
indicates that this impacts music engagement, particularly singing and \
playing instruments requiring ongoing tuning to external pitches or producing \
intervallic ratios. Interestingly, a small cohort of adult CI users has shown \
remarkable success in recovering or developing musical skills, but their \
success is poorly understood. Greater understanding of their efforts and \
attitudes may suggest potential rehabilitative approaches for other CI users. \

scholarship focuses on music and CIs. The CI recipients conveyed their \
experiences and attitudes regarding music and CIs through open-ended \
narratives. These narratives were analyzed using an integrative approach of \
inductive and deductive coding methods. The codes and themes that emerged \
through inductive methods were then organized within the Dynamic Problem \
Solving Model for Management of Music Listening Environments (Gfeller et al., \
2019a). OUTCOMES: This paper provides reflections of six CI users who \
successfully engage in active music making, including on-going tuning to \
external pitches and ensemble participation. Their perspectives emphasize the \
importance of pre-CI music instruction, extensive practice and immersion in \
music listening and playing, persistence and self-efficacy, and problem \
solving skills that optimize music engagement, and suggest possible \
strategies useful to other CI users interested in improving music \
experiences."}|>, <|"DB" -> {"DB" -> "PubMed"},

specifically members of a military band. METHODS: A historic cohort study was \
carried out comparing one group of 50 professional musicians (military band) \
with another group (44 subjects) without history of professional exposure to \
intense sound; the groups were homogenous (p<0.05%) in relation to gender \
(male) and age (about 35 years old). Tone threshold audiometry for \
conventional (from 500 to 8,000 Hz) and high frequencies was applied (from \
9,000 to 16,000 Hz). RESULTS: Exposure to music triggered permanent hearing \
impairment. As to conventional auditory thresholds, the exposed and \
non-exposed groups presented sensorineural hearing loss of 32 and 2.27%, \
respectively. The subjects exposed to music had 14.54 times more risks of \
acquiring sensorineural hearing loss than the non-exposed group. After 20 \
years of exposure to music, significant worsening was observed in auditory \
thresholds, especially at extended high frequencies, and differences occurred \
between the groups from the age of 30 on. CONCLUSION: Exposure to music \
caused permanent hearing impairment, showing differences in relation to the \
non-exposed group, registered in conventional audiometry and at \

establishing a link between humans and the arts through the senses and \
pleasure. Sound technicians are the link between musicians and audiences or \
consumers. Recently, general concern has arisen regarding occurrences of \
hearing loss induced by noise from excessively amplified sound-producing \
activities within leisure and professional environments. Sound technicians' \
activities expose them to the risk of hearing loss, and consequently put at \
risk their quality of life, the quality of the musical product and consumers' \
hearing. The aim of this study was to measure the prevalence of high \
frequency hearing loss consistent with noise exposure among sound technicians \
in Brazil and compare this with a control group without occupational noise \
exposure. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study comparing 177 \
participants in two groups: 82 sound technicians and 95 controls (non-sound \
technicians). A questionnaire on music listening habits and associated \
complaints was applied, and data were gathered regarding the professionals' \
numbers of working hours per day and both groups' hearing complaint and \
presence of tinnitus. The participants' ear canals were visually inspected \
using an otoscope. Hearing assessments were performed (tonal and speech \
audiometry) using a portable digital AD 229 E audiometer funded by FAPESP. \
RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference between the sound \
technicians and controls regarding age and gender. Thus, the study sample was \
homogenous and would be unlikely to lead to bias in the results. A \
statistically significant difference in hearing loss was observed between the \
groups: 50% among the sound technicians and 10.5% among the controls. The \
difference could be addressed to high sound levels. CONCLUSION: The sound \
technicians presented a higher prevalence of high frequency hearing loss \
consistent with noise exposure than did the general population, although the \
possibility of residual confounding due to unmeasured factors such as \
socioeconomic status cannot be ruled out."}|>, <|"DB" -> {"DB" -> "PubMed"},

improvements in speech understanding for those with severe to profound \
hearing loss; however, music perception remains a challenge for electric \
hearing. It is unclear whether the difficulties arise from limitations of \
sound processing, the nature of a damaged auditory system, or a combination \
of both. PURPOSE: To examine music perception performance with different \
acoustic and electric hearing configurations. RESEARCH DESIGN: Chord \
discrimination and timbre perception were tested in subjects representing \
four daily-use listening configurations: unilateral cochlear implant (CI), \
contralateral bimodal (CIHA), bilateral hearing aid (HAHA) and normal-hearing \
(NH) listeners. A same-different task was used for discrimination of two \
chords played on piano. Timbre perception was assessed using a 10-instrument \
forced-choice identification task. STUDY SAMPLE: Fourteen adults were \
included in each group, none of whom were professional musicians. DATA \
COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The number of correct responses was divided by the \
total number of presentations to calculate scores in percent correct. Data \
analyses were performed with Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance and \
linear regression. RESULTS: Chord discrimination showed a narrow range of \
performance across groups, with mean scores ranging between 72.5% (CI) and \
88.9% (NH). Significant differences were seen between the NH and all \
hearing-impaired groups. Both the HAHA and CIHA groups performed \
significantly better than the CI groups, and no significant differences were \
observed between the HAHA and CIHA groups. Timbre perception was \
significantly poorer for the hearing-impaired groups (mean scores ranged from \
50.3-73.9%) compared to NH (95.2%). Significantly better performance was \
observed in the HAHA group as compared to both groups with electric hearing \
(CI and CIHA). There was no significant difference in performance between the \
CIHA and CI groups. Timbre perception was a significantly more difficult task \
than chord discrimination for both the CI and CIHA groups, yet the easier \
task for the NH group. A significant difference between the two tasks was not \
seen in the HAHA group. CONCLUSIONS: Having impaired hearing decreases \
performance compared to NH across both chord discrimination and timbre \
perception tasks. For chord discrimination, having acoustic hearing improved \
performance compared to electric hearing only. Timbre perception \
distinguished those with acoustic hearing from those with electric hearing. \
Those with bilateral acoustic hearing, even if damaged, performed \
significantly better on this task than those requiring electrical \
stimulation, which may indicate that CI sound processing fails to capture and \
deliver the necessary acoustic cues for timbre perception. Further analysis \
of timbre characteristics in electric hearing may contribute to advancements \
in programming strategies to obtain optimal hearing outcomes."}|>,

hearing and subjective auditory symptoms in a group of nonprofessional \
pop/rock musicians who had experienced repeated exposures to intense sound \
levels during at least 5 yr of musical activity. DESIGN: An evaluation of \
both ears in 42 nonprofessional pop/rock musicians included pure-tone \
audiometry in the conventional and extended high-frequency range, the \
measurement of uncomfortable loudness levels, and an assessment of tinnitus \
and hypersensitivity to sound. Exclusion criteria were (a) the occurrence of \
acoustic trauma, (b) excessive noise exposure during occupational activities, \
(c) a history of recurrent otitis media, (d) previous ear surgery, (e) a \
fracture of the cranium, (f) ingestion of potentially ototoxic drugs, and (g) \
reported hearing difficulties within the immediate family. These audiometric \
results were then compared with a control group of 20 otologically normal \
young adults with no history of long-term noise exposure. RESULTS: After \
adjusting for age and gender, relative to ISO 7029, the mean hearing \
threshold in the frequency range of 3 to 8 kHz was 6 dB in the musicians and \
1.5 dB in the control group. This difference was statistically significant \
(Mann-Whitney rank sum test, p < 0.001). A significant difference was also \
observed between musicians using regular hearing protection during their \
activities (average 3 to 8 kHz thresholds = 2.4 dB) and musicians who never \
used such hearing protection (average 3 to 8 kHz thresholds = 8.2 dB), after \
adjusting for age and gender (Mann-Whitney rank sum test, p = 0.006). Eleven \
of the musicians (26%) were found to be hypersensitive to sound, and seven \
(17%) presented with tinnitus. Tinnitus assessment, however, did not reveal \
any clinically significant psychological distress in these individuals. \
CONCLUSIONS: Tinnitus and hypersensitivity to sound were observed in a \
significant minority within a group of nonprofessional pop/rock musicians who \
had experienced repeated exposure to intense sound levels over at least 5 yr \
but with minimal impact on their lives. Moreover, hearing loss was minimal in \
the subjects who always used ear protection, being only 0.9 dB higher than \
the control group. In contrast, hearing loss was significantly more \
pronounced, at 6.7 dB higher than the control group, in those musicians who \
never used ear protection. Continued education about the risk to hearing and \
the benefits of the persistent use of ear protection is warranted for \
musicians who are exposed frequently to intense sound levels."}|>,

DESIGN: Noise exposure background (NEB) was evaluated using an online \
questionnaire. Two-channel ABRs were recorded from the left ear using click \
stimuli. One channel utilized an ipsilateral tiptrode, and another channel \
utilized an ipsilateral mastoid electrode. ABRs were collected at 90, 75, and \
60 dBnHL. A mixed model was used to analyze the effect of group, electrodes, \
and stimulus levels on ABR wave I amplitude. STUDY SAMPLE: 75 collegiate \
students with normal hearing participated in the study and were grouped into \
a non-music major group (n\[NonBreakingSpace]=\[NonBreakingSpace]25), a brass \
major group (n\[NonBreakingSpace]=\[NonBreakingSpace]25), and a voice major \
group (n\[NonBreakingSpace]=\[NonBreakingSpace]25). RESULTS: The NEB was \
negatively associated with the action potential (AP) and ABR wave I amplitude \
for click intensity levels at 75 dBnHL. The mean amplitude of the ABR wave I \
was not significantly different between the three groups. CONCLUSION: The \
weak negative association of AP and ABR wave I amplitude with NEB cannot be \
solely attributed to evidence of cochlear synaptopathy in humans as the \
possibility of hair cell damage cannot be ruled out. Future research should \
investigate the effects of reduced cochlear output on the supra-threshold \

tasks such as speech intelligibility in noise and perception of music. In \
normal hearing (NH), musicians have been shown to better perform than \
non-musicians in auditory processing and perception, especially for \
challenging listening tasks. This \"musician effect\" was attributed to \
better processing of pitch cues, as well as better overall auditory cognitive \
functioning in musicians. Does the musician effect persist when pitch cues \
are degraded, as it would be in signals transmitted through a CI? To answer \
this question, NH musicians and non-musicians were tested while listening to \
unprocessed signals or to signals processed by an acoustic CI simulation. The \
task increasingly depended on pitch perception: (1) speech intelligibility \
(words and sentences) in quiet or in noise, (2) vocal emotion identification, \
and (3) melodic contour identification (MCI). For speech perception, there \
was no musician effect with the unprocessed stimuli, and a small musician \
effect only for word identification in one noise condition, in the CI \
simulation. For emotion identification, there was a small musician effect for \
both. For MCI, there was a large musician effect for both. Overall, the \
effect was stronger as the importance of pitch in the listening task \
increased. This suggests that the musician effect may be more rooted in pitch \
perception, rather than in a global advantage in cognitive processing (in \
which musicians would have performed better in all tasks). The results \
further suggest that musical training before (and possibly after) \
implantation might offer some advantage in pitch processing that could \
partially benefit speech perception, and more strongly emotion and music \
perception."}|>, <|"DB" -> {"DB" -> "PubMed"},

impact of musicians professional and private life. The objectives of the \
study were therefore to: (1) describe the epidemiology of tinnitus including \
its severity in classical orchestra musicians, (2) investigate the \
association between tinnitus severity in classical musicians and their \
cumulative lifetime sound exposure, and (3) the association between tinnitus \
and hearing thresholds. DESIGN: The study population included all musicians \
from five Danish symphony orchestras. Answers regarding their perception of \
tinnitus were received from 325 musicians, and 212 musicians were also tested \
with audiometry. Any tinnitus and severe tinnitus were two definitions of \
tinnitus used as outcomes and analyzed in relation to an estimation of the \
cumulative lifetime sound exposure from sound measurements and previously \
validated questionnaires and the average hearing threshold of 3, 4, and \
6\[ThinSpace]kHz. RESULTS: Thirty-five percentage of all musicians (31% \
female and 38% of male musicians) reported having experienced at least one \
episode of tinnitus lasting for more than 5 minutes during their life. Severe \
tinnitus with a severe impact on daily life was reported by 19% of the \
musicians (18% of female and 21% of male musicians). The severity of tinnitus \
was associated with increased lifetime sound exposure but not to poorer high \
frequency hearing thresholds when the lifetime sound exposure was considered. \
The odds ratio for an increase in one unit of tinnitus severity was 1.25 (95% \
CI, 1.12-1.40) for every 1 dB increase in lifetime sound exposure. \
CONCLUSION: Musicians frequently report tinnitus. Any tinnitus and severe \
tinnitus are significantly associated with the cumulative lifetime sound \
exposure, which was shown to be the most important factor not only for the \
prevalence but also for the severity of tinnitus-even in musicians without \
hearing loss. High-frequency hearing thresholds and tinnitus severity were \
correlated only if the cumulative lifetime sound exposure was excluded from \
the analyses."}|>, <|"DB" -> {"DB" -> "PubMed"},

each instrument if the mean sound level was below 85 dB in all musicians, and \

considered a high-risk instruments and some other instruments had different \
mean sound level (in some participants <85 dB and some other players >85 dB), \

conservation practices. Although musicians typically report a range of \
difficulties when wearing earplugs, there are many who have managed to \
successfully incorporate earplugs into their practice of music. OBJECTIVE: \
The study aim was to provide a detailed account of earplug usage from the \
perspective of the musician, including motivating factors, practical \
strategies, and attitudes. METHODS: In-depth interviews with 23 musicians \
were transcribed and content analysis was performed. Responses were coded and \
classified into three main themes: advantages, disadvantages, and usage \
patterns and strategies, together with an overlapping fourth theme, youth \
perspectives. RESULTS: Several positive aspects of wearing earplugs were \
identified, including long-term hearing protection and reduced levels of \
fatigue and pain. Musicians reported that earplugs present few problems for \
communication, improve sound clarity in ensembles, are discreet, and are easy \
to handle. However, earplugs also present challenges, including an overall \
dullness of sound, reduced immediacy, and an impaired ability to judge \
balance and intonation due to the occlusion effect, all of which influence \
usage habits and patterns. CONCLUSION: The experiences of the younger \
musicians and long-term users of earplugs indicate that practice, \
persistence, and a flexible approach are required for successful earplug \
usage. In time, there may be greater acceptance of earplugs, particularly \
amongst a new generation of musicians, some of whom regard the earplugs as a \
performance enhancement tool as well as a protective device."}|>,

musicians' hearing protectors (MHP). DESIGN: Audiologists with experience \
treating musicians were invited to complete a survey on their service \
delivery. A second survey was administered to manufacturers of MHPs. STUDY \
SAMPLE: Four manufacturers of MHP and 31 audiologists completed the surveys. \
Post hoc analyses were performed comparing the responses of audiologists with \
more versus less clinical experience; and those with and without musical \
training. RESULTS: There was considerable variation in the audiological care \
provided to musicians. Only one-third of audiologists performed pure-tone \
audiometry prior to MHP fitting, and there was little consistency across the \
sample in relation to impression taking, preferred attenuation or selection \
of canal length. There was also significant variation in the manufacturers' \
approach to MHP, each of whom provided different recommendations regarding \
preferred impression techniques and material viscosity. CONCLUSIONS: The \
results of this study reveal lack of consistency across the hearing \
healthcare sector with respect to care of musicians' hearing, with potential \
to impact upon the satisfaction with, and usage of, MHP. There is need for \
evidence-based, best practice guidelines and training to support clinical \
audiologists in providing optimal care."}|>, <|"DB" -> {"DB" -> "PubMed"},

problems related to their profession. The aim of this paper was to assess \
whether work-related musician diseases are included into the Official Spanish \
List of Occupational Diseases and, if so, to describe and quantify those \
recognized in recent years. METHODS: The Official Spanish List of \
Occupational Diseases was searched to identify occupational diseases \
affecting musicians. We then conducted an incidence study of those \
occupational diseases recognized under code 29.32 Composers, musicians and \
singers (CNO-2011) for the period 2007 to 2014. Cases and rates were \
described and represented by disease type, gender and year of recognition. \
RESULTS: Ten entries were identified as musician diseases in the official \
occupational disease list; mostly involved musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) \
and hearing loss. Mental health disorders and focal dystonia are not included \
in the list. In the period 2007-2014, 213 cases were identified, 120 for men \
and 93 for women. Of these, 81% were MSD, 11% hearing loss and 7% vocal cord \
nodules. The average incidence rate per 100,000 was 18.3 (19.1 in men and \

the medial olivocochlear hearing system functions, the high frequency hearing \
thresholds and speech discrimination in noise performance can guide us in \
assessing the risk of hearing loss among violinists. It is aimed to \
investigate possible hearing damage that is not reflected in pure tone \
hearing thresholds in violinists. METHODS: The participants \
(n\[ThinSpace]=\[ThinSpace]50) who have normal hearing and the ages of 18-30 \
were included in this study in two groups: violinists and controls who are \
unrelated to music. High frequency audiometer, auditory figure ground test \
(AFG) for speech discrimination in noise performance, Distortion Product \
Otoacoustic Emission (DPOAE) and contralateral suppression on DPOAE for \
medial olivocochlear system function tests were applied to all participants \
as well as routine audiological tests. RESULTS: The high frequency hearing \
thresholds were obtained higher in violinists compared to the controls. In \
violinists, the AFG test scores and the suppression amount at \
1\[NonBreakingSpace]kHz were lower than the controls. In addition, DPOAE \
responses at 4-6\[NonBreakingSpace]kHz were obtained lower in violinists \
(p\[ThinSpace]<\[ThinSpace]0.05). CONCLUSION: The reason for high frequency \
hearing loss, decreased DPOAE response amplitudes, and poor medial \

exposure to high-level noise caused by the violin, one of the closest musical \
instruments. Routine and comprehensive audiological follow-up is crucial for \

effects of the semioccluded vocal tract exercise with Finnish tube on the \
vocal quality of a deaf musician. METHODS: A seven-day protocol with Finnish \
tube was performed with guidance for its home replication twice a day. A \
46-years-old man with profound bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, musician \
and composer participated. Before and after the application of the protocol \
had undergone tonal audiometry, nasofibrolaryngoscopy, acoustic analysis with \
Praat and auditory-perceptual evaluation of the voice with Voice Profile \

auditory-perceptual analysis identified reduction of the deviation in lip \
spreading, extensive labial range, raised tongue body, pharyngeal expansion, \
nasal resonance, larynx height, larynx and vocal tract tension and \
irregularity, pitch, speech rate, and a better respiratory support. The \
maximum phonation time reduced, probably because of elimination of the abrupt \
vocal attack and tension, articulatory deviations, improvement in voicing and \
the absence of the use of expiratory reserve air. The fundamental frequency \
became lower, and the first, second, third, and fourth formants became \
higher. The jitter increased, and the shimmer reduced. CONCLUSION: The use of \
the Finnish tube might have facilitated the voicing sensations in the deaf \
musician, by enhancing the tactile-kinesthetic perception of the vocal tract \
and brought a greater source-filter interaction."}|>,

There was a larger exposure to the left ear than to the right ear, and we \
observed a left-ear specific temporary threshold shift (TTS) after the violin \
practice. Left-ear CEOAEs decreased proportionally to the TTS. The exposure \

phantom sound, is a common otological condition that affects almost 15% of \
the general population. It is known that noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) \
and tinnitus exhibit a high level of comorbidity in individuals exposed to \
intense noise and music. However, the influence of genetic variants \
associated with NIHL on tinnitus remains elusive. We hypothesized that young \
musicians carrying genetic variants associated with NIHL would exhibit a \
higher prevalence of tinnitus than their counterparts. METHODS: To test this \
hypothesis, we analyzed the database by Bhatt et al. (2020) (originally \
developed by Phillips et al., 2015) that investigated the genetic links to \
NIHL in young college-aged musicians. The present study identified 186 \
participants (average \
age\[VeryThinSpace]=\[VeryThinSpace]20.3\[VeryThinSpace]yrs, \
range\[VeryThinSpace]=\[VeryThinSpace]18-25\[VeryThinSpace]yrs) with normal \
tympanometry and otoscopic findings and with no missing data. We included 19 \
single nucleotide polymorphisms in 13 cochlear genes that were previously \
associated with NIHL. The candidate genes include: KCNE1, KCNQ1, CDH23, GJB2, \
GJB4, KCNJ10, CAT, HSP70, PCDH70, MYH14, GRM7, PON2, and ESRRB. RESULTS: We \
find that individuals with at least one minor allele of rs163171 \
(C\[VeryThinSpace]>\[VeryThinSpace]T) in KCNQ1 exhibit significantly higher \
odds of reporting tinnitus compared to individuals carrying the major allele \
of rs163171. KCNE1 rs2070358 revealed a suggestive association \
(p\[VeryThinSpace]=\[VeryThinSpace]0.049) with tinnitus, but the FDR \
corrected p-value did not achieve statistical significance \
(p\[VeryThinSpace]<\[VeryThinSpace]0.05). A history of ear infection and \
sound level tolerance showed a statistically significant association with \
tinnitus. Music exposure showed a suggestive association trend with tinnitus. \
Biological sex revealed a statistically significant association with \
distortion product otoacoustic emissions SNR measures. CONCLUSIONS: We \
concluded that KCNQ1/KCNE1 voltage-gated potassium ion channel plays a \
critical role in the pathogenesis of NIHL and tinnitus. Further research is \
required to construct clinical tools for identifying genetically predisposed \
individuals well before they acquire NIHL and tinnitus."}|>,

energy can be found below 1 kHz and even 500 Hz but not below 100 Hz. To find \
out about possible hearing loss due to professional choir singing, we \
measured the hearing threshold level of 62 choir singers in a large opera \

The permanent threshold shifts at 250 Hz and above are most likely noise \
induced with choir singing as noise source. However, hearing losses at 125 Hz \

16\[NonBreakingSpace]kHz) thresholds, otoacoustic emissions (OAEs), auditory \
brainstem responses (ABRs), speech perception in noise (SPiN), and \
self-reported tinnitus, hyperacusis and hearing in noise difficulties. Total \
lifetime noise exposure was similar between musicians and non-musicians, the \
majority of which could be accounted for by recreational activities. \
Musicians showed significantly greater ABR wave I/V ratios than non-musicians \
and were also more likely to report experience of - and/or more severe - \
tinnitus, hyperacusis and hearing in noise difficulties, irrespective of \
noise exposure. A secondary analysis revealed that individuals with the \
highest levels of noise exposure had reduced outer hair cell function \
compared to individuals with the lowest levels of noise exposure, as measured \
by OAEs. OAE level was also related to PTA and EHF thresholds. High levels of \
noise exposure were also associated with a significant increase in ABR wave V \
latency, but only for males, and a higher prevalence and severity of \
hyperacusis. These findings suggest that there may be sub-clinical effects of \
noise exposure on various hearing metrics even at a relatively young age, but \
do not support a link between lifetime noise exposure and proxy measures of \
cochlear synaptopathy such as ABR wave amplitudes and SPiN. Closely \
monitoring OAEs, PTA and EHF thresholds when conventional PTA is within the \
clinically 'normal' range could provide a useful early metric of \
noise-induced hearing damage. This may be particularly relevant to \
early-career musicians as they progress through a period of intensive musical \
training, and thus interventions to protect hearing longevity may be vital."}\

musical emotion using excerpts from familiar music that includes highly \
expressed emotions to classify emotional choices. However, using familiar \
music to study musical emotions in people with acquired hearing loss could \
produce ambiguous results as to whether the emotional perception is due to \
previous experiences or listening to the current musical stimuli. To overcome \
this limitation, we developed new musical stimuli to study emotional \
perception without the effects of episodic memory. METHODS: A musician was \
instructed to compose five melodies with evenly distributed pitches around 1 \
kHz. The melodies were created to express the emotions of happy, sad, angry, \
tender, and neutral. To evaluate whether these melodies expressed the \
intended emotions, two methods were applied. First, we classified the \
expressed emotions of melodies with selected musical features from 60 \
features using genetic algorithm-based k-nearest neighbors. Second, \
forty-four people with normal hearing participated in an online survey \
regarding the emotional perception of music based on dimensional and discrete \
approaches to evaluate the musical stimuli set. RESULTS: Twenty-four selected \
musical features produced classification for intended emotions with an \
accuracy of 76%. The results of the online survey in the normal hearing (NH) \
group showed that the intended emotions were selected significantly more \
often than the others. K-means clustering analysis revealed that melodies \
with arousal and valence ratings corresponded to representative quadrants of \
interest. Additionally, the applicability of the stimuli was tested in 4 \
individuals with high-frequency hearing loss. CONCLUSION: By applying the \
individuals with NH, the musical stimuli were shown to classify emotions with \
high accuracy, as expressed. These results confirm that the set of musical \
stimuli can be used to study the perceived emotion in music, demonstrating \
the validity of the musical stimuli, independent of innate musical bias such \
as due to episodic memory. Furthermore, musical stimuli could be helpful for \
further studying perceived musical emotion in people with hearing loss \
because of the controlled pitch for each emotion."}|>,

filtered in either a low- or a high-frequency region, leading to variations \

resolved at a similar F0 in musicians and non-musicians, suggesting similar \
peripheral frequency selectivity in the two groups of listeners. In a \

indicator of the required effort in performing the same pitch discrimination \
task for conditions of varying resolvability and task difficulty. \
Pupillometry responses indicated a lower processing effort in the musicians \

key/fast tempo and minor key/slow tempo) and ambiguous (major key/slow tempo, \
and minor key/fast tempo) musical stimuli. Both CI and NH participants \

to investigate the effects of musical experience and aging on SIN perception \

ameliorating deficient SIN perception in older adults by musical training. \
DESIGN: Forty-eight older musicians, 29 older nonmusicians, 48 young \
musicians, and 24 young nonmusicians all with (near) normal peripheral \
hearing were recruited. The SIN task was recognizing nonsense speech \
sentences either perceptually colocated or separated with a noise masker \
(energetic masking) or a two-talker speech masker (informational masking). \
Auditory working memory was measured by auditory digit span. Path analysis \
was used to examine the direct and indirect effects of musical expertise and \
age on SIN perception performance. RESULTS: Older musicians outperformed \
older nonmusicians in auditory working memory and all SIN conditions (noise \
separation, noise colocation, speech separation, speech colocation), but such \
musician advantages were absent in young adults. Path analysis showed that \
age and musical training had opposite effects on auditory working memory, \
which played a significant mediation role in SIN perception. In addition, the \
type of musical training did not differentiate SIN perception regardless of \
age. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide evidence that musical training \
offsets age-related speech perception deficit at adverse listening conditions \
by preserving auditory working memory. Our findings highlight auditory \
working memory in supporting speech perception amid competing noise in older \
adults, and underline musical training as a means of \"cognitive reserve\" \

quantify noise exposures generated during a 1 hr trumpet practice session and \
to determine whether distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) are \
affected by such exposure, to describe the distribution of intensity levels \
and temporal characteristics of noise produced by trumpet practice, and to \
determine the effect of earplug use on generated noise levels and DPOAEs. \
DESIGN: In experiment 1, eight college-age trumpeters underwent an otoscopic \
inspection, tympanometry, and pure-tone threshold testing. Using a \
Grason-Stadler 60 DPOAE system, DPOAEs were recorded just before a 1 hr \
practice session, at 2 min after the practice session, 4 min after the \
session, and at 4 min intervals thereafter for a total period of 1 hr. A \
Hewlett-Packard 3569A Real-Time Frequency Analyzer was used to integrate \
noise levels to assess the overall level of exposure averaged over the course \
of the hour. In experiment 2, seven different trumpeters participated in two \
data-collection sessions. The main difference between the sessions was that \
subjects wore E.A.R. earplugs during session 2. All other design parameters \
were similar to those of experiment 1. RESULTS: Noise levels generated during \
the practice sessions resulted in average Leqs of 95.96, 96.6, and 96.43 dB \
SPL. A sound-distribution analysis revealed that noise levels exceeded 85 dB \
for an average of 43.73 min per session. Mean Leq values did not change when \
subjects wore earplugs (96.6 dB SPL versus 96.43 dB SPL.) Predictions (ISO \
1999) of the increased risk of hearing loss that trumpeters would experience \
at 40, 50, and 60 years of age were made and indicated that trumpeters are at \
a significantly increased risk of hearing loss over that contributable to age \
alone. This increased risk is apparent with as little as 1 hr of exposure per \
day and suggests that 60-year-old male and female musicians exposed to \
trumpet noise for 4 hr per day for 40 years would be 85% and 300%, \
respectively, more likely to have hearing loss than their peers with negative \
noise exposure histories. Statistically significant decreases in DPOAE \
amplitudes from the prenoise exposure collection point to the 2 min post \
exposure point were observed only when subjects were not wearing earplugs \
during their practice session. Recovery of DPOAEs to baseline level varied in \
form for four test frequencies. CONCLUSION: During solitary play, trumpeters \
generate noise levels that temporarily decrease DPOAE amplitudes and that by \
themselves have the potential to result in permanent noise-induced hearing \
loss. Trumpeters who practice/perform over a period of years should be \
concerned about the implications of their craft on their hearing and should \
be offered personalized hearing conservation programs. The use of earplugs \
offers a practical and cost-effective means of hearing protection and, for \
this group of trumpeters, did not lead to an increase in playing level."}|>,

result from exposure to excessive levels of music of different genres. \
Marching band music, with its heavy emphasis on brass and percussion, is one \
type that is a likely contributor to music-induced hearing disorders, \
although specific data on sound pressure levels of marching bands have not \
been widely studied. Furthermore, if marching band music does lead to \
music-induced hearing disorders, the musicians may not be the only \
individuals at risk. Support personnel such as directors, equipment managers, \
and performing arts healthcare providers may also be exposed to potentially \
damaging sound pressures. Thus, we sought to explore to what degree \
healthcare providers receive sound dosages above recommended limits during \
their work with a marching band. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to \
determine the sound exposure of healthcare professionals (specifically, \
athletic trainers [ATs]) who provide on-site care to a large, well-known \
university marching band. We hypothesized that sound pressure levels to which \
these individuals were exposed would exceed the National Institute for \
Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) daily percentage allowance. RESEARCH \
DESIGN: Descriptive observational study. STUDY SAMPLE: Eight ATs working with \
a well-known American university marching band volunteered to wear noise \
dosimeters. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: During the marching band season, \
ATs wore an Etymotic ER-200D dosimeter whenever working with the band at \
outdoor rehearsals, indoor field house rehearsals, and outdoor performances. \
The dosimeters recorded dose percent exposure, equivalent continuous sound \
levels in A-weighted decibels, and duration of exposure. For comparison, a \
dosimeter also was worn by an AT working in the university's performing arts \
medicine clinic. Participants did not alter their typical duties during any \
data collection sessions. Sound data were collected with the dosimeters set \
at the NIOSH standards of 85 dBA threshold and 3 dBA exchange rate; the NIOSH \
100% daily dose is an exposure to 85 dBA over 8 h. Dose data for each session \
were converted to a standardized dose intensity by dividing the dose \
percentage by the duration of the exposure and setting the NIOSH standard as \
a factor of 1.0. This allowed convenient relative comparisons of dose \
percentages of vastly different exposure durations. Analysis of variance \
examined relationships of noise exposures among the venues; post hoc testing \
was used to assess pairwise differences. RESULTS: As hypothesized, ATs were \
exposed to high sound pressure levels and dose percentages greatly exceeding \
those recommended by NIOSH. Higher sound levels were recorded in performance \
venues compared with rehearsal venues. In addition to the band music, crowd \
noise and public address systems contribute to high sound levels at \
performances. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that healthcare providers \
working with marching bands are exposed to dangerous levels of sound during \
performances. This is especially true at venues such as football stadiums, \
where crowd noise and public address systems add to sound pressure. A hearing \
conservation program, including protection, should be required for all \
healthcare staff who work with marching bands. Moreover, our results should \
inform hearing conservation practices for marching musicians, directors, and \
support personnel."}|>, <|"DB" -> {"DB" -> "PubMed"},

accumulation of loud sound over a long period of time as seen in people \
involved in musical performance such as rock musicians and mixing engineers; \
2) abrupt noise induced hearing impairment triggered by loud sound and 3) \
state of deafness which is a progressing stage towards recovery of noise \
induced temporary threshold shift (NITTS), which occurs temporarily by a loud \
sound stimulus, and hearing ability recovers afterward. However, it is \
considered that these musical loud sounds not only changes every moment \
according to method of performing or type of music, but the volume of the \
sound actually reaching the auditory sense differs largely by locations and \
direction of the ear and speakers. So it becomes necessary to measure the \
accumulation of the noise which each individual is exposed under over a long \
period of time and at the same time carry out the regular medical checkups \
including hearing test to check the initiation and advancement of the noise \
induced hearing impairment. Then we can examine the relationship between \
loudness of the environmental noise and initiation and advancement of the \
hearing impairment. However, there has not been a device which is compact and \
measures noise exposure individually over a long period of time. So we have \
experimentally produced ultra compact noise dosimeter which we named Noise \
Badge, and with it we actually measured individual noise exposure over a long \
time in rock music, noise in discotheque and noisy factory. Then we examined \
the relationship between these loud sound and noise induced temporary \
threshold shift (NITTS) in discotheques and noise proof room using simulation \
of loud sound exposure. Moreover, we measured the most comfortable loudness \

study were 23- to 48-year-old musicians, with and without hearing loss, who \
had 10 years of musical training or comparable professional experience. For \
this study, PLLs and MALLs were established for the musician's own voice, \
whereas the levels of other onstage musical signals were systematically \
varied. PLLs for in-ear monitors were found at significantly lower levels \
than for floor monitors (approximately 0.6 dB). RESULTS: PLLs for in-ear \
monitors were found at significantly lower levels than for floor monitors \
(approximately 0.6 dB). However, despite large spectral differences, PLLs \
across the 2 monitor types were small enough that the same recommended \
exposure time would be advocated based on National Institute for Occupational \
Safety and Health and Occupational Safety and Health Administration \
recommendations. MALL data also indicated significantly lower levels \
(approximately 6.0 dB) when musicians were using in-ear monitors in \
comparison to floor monitors. CONCLUSION: The much larger difference suggests \
that musicians' risk of noise exposure may be reduced by the use of in-ear \
monitors. However, given the similar PLL results and known monitor output \
levels, proper counseling would likely be required before this potential \
advantage would be realized."}|>, <|"DB" -> {"DB" -> "PubMed"},

exposure and the risk of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) in orchestral \
musicians. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Questionnaire inquiries and sound pressure \
level measurements were carried out in 63 musicians. Based on these data the \
risk assessment of the NIHL was performed according to ISO 1999:1990 (PN-ISO \
1999:1990). RESULTS: The classical orchestral musicians are usually exposed \
to sound at equivalent continuous A-weighted sound pressure levels of 81-90 \
dB (10-90th percentile), for 20-48 h (10-90th percentile) per week. \
Occupational exposures to such sound levels over 40 years of employment cause \
the risk of hearing impairment (expressed as mean hearing threshold level for \
2, 3 and 4 kHz equal or greater than 25 dB) in the range of 13-33% and 9-33% \
in females and males, respectively. The highest risk is related to playing \
clarinet (up to 33%), tube (up to 34%), trumpet (up to 37%), trombone (up to \
40%), percussion section (up to 41%) and horn (up to 47%). About 46% of \
respondents noticed hearing impairment. Nearly every fifth musician \
complained of tinnitus while almost half (48%) of them--of hyperacusis. \
However, only 14% of musicians declared present or past usage of hearing \
protective devices (HPDs) while over twice of them (30%) intended to use HPDs \
in the future."}|>, <|"DB" -> {"DB" -> "PubMed"},

oral organs are important when playing wind or brass instruments. Although \
there are some reports on dental treatment for musicians, few studies have \
investigated their acoustic performance following treatment. This report \
describes the prosthodontic rehabilitation provided for an oboist who had \
lost a tooth as a result of trauma and includes an evaluation of her \
subsequent musical performance using acoustic analyzes. CASE DESCRIPTION: The \
patient was a 63-year-old professional oboe player who fractured the upper \
and lower alveolar bone and avulsed the upper right central incisor during a \
fall due to epileptic seizure. While the alveolar fracture was healing, she \
sought maxillofacial rehabilitation for the missing tooth to maintain her \
ability to play the oboe. Her rehabilitation consisted of a provisional \
removable prosthesis with an acrylic base and clasps followed by a fixed \
implant prosthesis. A recording of her musical performance was objectively \
analyzed at each stage of treatment. Rhythm analysis confirmed the stability \
of notes played rapidly. Her performance dynamics were analyzed by \
psychoacoustic measurements. Her satisfaction with the prosthesis was \
assessed by a self-reported questionnaire. The results of the acoustic \
evaluation helped to adjust the provisional prosthesis so that it was \
suitable for playing the oboe and the final prosthesis was designed \
accordingly. CONCLUSION: Prosthetic dental treatment for this patient \
included both subjective and objective evaluations that helped to ensure that \
she could continue playing the oboe at her previous performance level."}|>,

verifying the influence of time of exposure to amplified music. METHOD: a \
questionnaire was answered by 23 rock and roll musicians (46 ears) who were \
also evaluated by means of pure tone audiometry, immitance audiometry and \
transient/distortion product evoked otoacoustic emissions (OAET and OAEPD). \
RESULTS: regarding the time of exposure to music, values close to the limit \
of acceptance (tending to be significants) were found in the frequencies of \
0.5 and 6kHz, in the pure tone audiometry. A statistically significant \
difference was also found in the OAET test in the frequency of 2kHz and also \
in the frequencies of 0.75, 1, 4 and 6kHz in the OAEPD test. CONCLUSION: the \
results indicate that although hearing loss was not found in the studied \
population, alteration in the register of the OAE already exists, suggesting \
alteration of the cochlear function. Regarding time of exposure, the results \
indicate that musicians with more than 10 years of practice present \

blocks, and two musical contexts were tested, with the overlap between melody \
and distracter notes either gradually increasing or decreasing. CONCLUSIONS: \
Visual cues, musical training, and musical context all affected the \
difficulty of extracting the melody from a background of interleaved random \
distracter notes. Visual cues were effective in reducing the difficulty of \
segregating the melody from distracter notes, even in individuals with no \
musical training. These results are consistent with theories that indicate an \

M\[EAcute]ni\[EGrave]re's syndrome 5 years ago, is presented. Recently the \
symptoms became more polymorphic, revealing the association between benign \
paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), M\[EAcute]ni\[EGrave]re's syndrome and \
high frequency hearing loss in an autoimmune background. Besides general, \
neurological and ENT examination, the diagnostic workup comprised of tonal \
audiogram, brain stem auditory evoked potentials, computerized dynamic \
posturography and videonistagmography. RESULTS: The final diagnosis was acute \
noise trauma, M\[EAcute]ni\[EGrave]re's syndrome, left horizontal \
semicircular canal BPPV, bilateral sensorineural sudden aggravated hearing \
loss in high frequencies (above 9 kHz) and allegedly autoimmune inner ear \
disease. Treatment with an association of corticosteroids, vasodilators and \
vitamins combined with Vannucchi's maneuver were followed by a significant \
relief of the symptoms. CONCLUSION: Although no causal relationship was found \
between acoustic trauma and increased endolymphatic pressure, both literature \
data and the case presented show that intense and prolonged noise exposure \
may aggravate peripheral vestibular syndrome."}|>,

health organisation global pharmacovigilance database. The case report \
concerns a 22-year-old patient with perfect pitch with untreated left \
temporal partial epilepsy. Following a generalized seizure, the introduction \
of CBZ prolonged release (200mg twice a day) is decided. As soon as CBZ is \
introduced, the patient notices a change in pitch perception, about a \
semitone lower. This adverse effect persisted despite a gradual decrease in \
doses. The patient reported a total recovery of his perfect pitch when CBZ \
stopped completely 11 years later. In the French pharmacovigilance database, \
only one other case of pitch perception modification under CBZ was recorded \
(no cases were found with oxcarbazepine, lacosamide, sodium valproate, \
lamotrigine, levetiracetam, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone, \
ethosuximide, vigabatrine, felbamate, gabapentin, tiagabine and topiramate). \

oxcarbazepine and lacosamide, identified in the literature mainly in the \
Japanese population, in experienced musicians. A rapid onset after the \
introduction of treatment, a complete resolution of symptoms, in most cases \
upon discontinuation of treatment, is observed, with no sequelae reported. \

from a bilateral tinnitus is presented. The musician reported the tinnitus to \
be louder and more straining when playing his Vuillaume violin (France 1840) \
as compared with his Carcassi violin (Italy 1763). CASE REPORT: In the \
42-year-old musician, audiometry revealed a normal hearing threshold in the \
right ear and a slight hearing loss in the left ear of up to 20 dB between 2 \
kHz and 8 kHz. Transitory evoked otoacoustic emissions could only be measured \
in the right ear. The tinnitus could be masked (distance type); residual \
inhibition was only seen in the right ear. By sound intensity measurements in \
both external auditory canals, the different sound spectra of both violins \
could be demonstrated. When playing with \"forte\" intensity, sound pressure \
reached peaks of over 90 dB. The tinnitus was ameliorated by lidocaine \
infusions. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The different sound spectra of both \
violins may be the reason for the enhancement of the musician's tinnitus. \
Interference of air and bone-conducted sound could lead to a cochlear overlap \
and thus influence the tinnitus although such a phenomenon can not be \
verified. It was previously reported that high-pitched instruments may cause \
tinnitus sensations in performing musicians. A review of the literature \
surprisingly reveals that although professional musicians are exposed to \
sound pressure levels that may cause hearing impairment, only very few do \
develop one. This fact has to be taken into account whenever an occupational \
disease is suspected."}|>, <|"DB" -> {"DB" -> "PubMed"},

musical emotion using excerpts from familiar music that includes highly \
expressed emotions to classify emotional choices. However, using familiar \
music to study musical emotions in people with acquired hearing loss could \
produce ambiguous results as to whether the emotional perception is due to \
previous experiences or listening to the current musical stimuli. To overcome \
this limitation, we developed new musical stimuli to study emotional \
perception without the effects of episodic memory. METHODS: A musician was \
instructed to compose five melodies with evenly distributed pitches around 1 \
kHz. The melodies were created to express the emotions of happy, sad, angry, \
tender, and neutral. To evaluate whether these melodies expressed the \
intended emotions, two methods were applied. First, we classified the \
expressed emotions of melodies with selected musical features from 60 \
features using genetic algorithm-based k-nearest neighbors. Second, \
forty-four people with normal hearing participated in an online survey \
regarding the emotional perception of music based on dimensional and discrete \
approaches to evaluate the musical stimuli set. RESULTS: Twenty-four selected \
musical features produced classification for intended emotions with an \
accuracy of 76%. The results of the online survey in the normal hearing (NH) \
group showed that the intended emotions were selected significantly more \
often than the others. K-means clustering analysis revealed that melodies \
with arousal and valence ratings corresponded to representative quadrants of \
interest. Additionally, the applicability of the stimuli was tested in 4 \
individuals with high-frequency hearing loss. CONCLUSION: By applying the \
individuals with NH, the musical stimuli were shown to classify emotions with \
high accuracy, as expressed. These results confirm that the set of musical \
stimuli can be used to study the perceived emotion in music, demonstrating \
the validity of the musical stimuli, independent of innate musical bias such \
as due to episodic memory. Furthermore, musical stimuli could be helpful for \
further studying perceived musical emotion in people with hearing loss \
because of the controlled pitch for each emotion."}|>,

group of classical musicians from Spain. We analysed the frequency of device \
use by instrument based on contingency tables analysed by \[Chi]2 tests. \
Results: One hundred and ninety-four Spanish classical orchestral musicians \
voluntarily completed the questionnaire. The percentage of musicians who \
reported using hearing protection in our survey was very low and varied with \
the type of instrument played. However, we found a high prevalence of \
subjective auditory disorders within this group. Conclusion: Few Spanish \

the \[OpenCurlyQuote]conventional\[CloseCurlyQuote] CAEP evoked in response \
to stimulus onset. In 24 normal-hearing subjects, consisting of 12 musicians \

recorded in response to 12% frequency increases at four base frequencies \
(0.5, 1, 2 and 4 kHz). ACC amplitudes and latencies were compared to \
frequency discrimination thresholds at each base frequency, and to speech \
perception in noise. Frequency discrimination and speech perception in noise \
were significantly better for larger ACC N1-P2 amplitudes and shorter N1 \
latencies, whereas both frequency discrimination and speech perception did \
not correlate with onset CAEP amplitude or latency. Multiple regression \
analysis for prediction of speech perception in noise revealed that the \
strongest model was obtained by averaging over three frequencies (1, 2 and 4 \
kHz) with two significant predictors: hearing loss (R2 = 0.52) and ACC \
latency (R2 = 0.35). Thus, explaining 87% of the variance, this model \
indicates that subjects with longer ACC latencies have worse speech \
perception in noise than subjects with comparable hearing thresholds and \
shorter ACC latencies. If hearing loss was removed from this model, the \
combination of ACC amplitude and latency over those three frequencies \
explained 74% of the total variance in speech perception in noise. There were \
no differences in frequency discrimination, speech perception, CAEP, or ACC \
between recreational musicians and non-musicians. We conclude that the \
objective ACC N1 latency is a good predictor of speech perception in noise. \

hearing problems in musicians due to the constant exposure of loud sounds \
during activities such as group rehearsals, music performances and individual \
practices. Most of them reveal that many musicians are unaware of the risks \
faced in making music and are resistant to preventive actions. However, it \
seems reasonable to reverse this context based on the development of \
preventive actions during the graduation time of this public. Objectives To \
suggest a protocol of educational actions regarding hearing health with \
professors from higher education institutions in music. Methods The \
elaboration of the protocol of educational actions in hearing health was \
based on active learning and problematizing methodologies, to happen through \
activities developed in the academic environment. Results The protocol was \
developed to be applied in six modules, with of 1 h 30 min each, and \
contemplates the following topics (1) notions of anatomy-physiology of \
hearing, effects of high sound intensity, control measures and means of \
prevention of hearing loss; (2) acoustic characteristics of the work \
environment and workload in practical music classes and/or supervising \
internships (3) workshops towards the use of sound pressure level measurement \
apps and hearing screening apps; (4) composition and recording of jingles and \
pod-casts related to the risks of exposure to high intensity music to play \
for music students. Conclusion The development of the activities planned in \
the protocol can lead professors to incorporate the concepts and attitudes \
related to hearing health, to act as promotion agents to positively influence \
new generations of musicians with regard to that matter. The results must be \
continuously evaluated to identify the weaknesses and potential of the \
protocol."}|>, <|"DB" -> {"DB" -> "Embase"},

professional musicians in the UK. BACK-GROUND: Tinnitus is the experience of \
sound when an external source is absent, primarily associated with the ageing \
process, hearing loss, and noise exposure. Amongst populations exposed to \
industrial noise, noise exposure and noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) have \
been found to be the factors most associated with tinnitus. The risk of NIHL \
amongst professional musicians is greater than that amongst the general \
population, meaning they may be at increased risk of tinnitus. METHODS: \
Seventy-four professional musicians completed an online survey involving \
closed and open-ended questions, and completed the Tinnitus fuctional Index \
(TFI) questionnaire. Descriptive statistics and thematic analysis of \
open-ended qualitative responses were used to analyse the data. RESULTS: \
Three themes were generated from the analysis of the responses to the \
open-ended questions. These themes were: (1) the impact of tinnitus on the \
lives of professional musicians, (2) professional musician experience of \
tinnitus services, support, and hearing health and safety, and (3) the \
support professional musicians want. The mean global TFI score for \
professional musicians was 39.05, interpreted as tinnitus being a moderate \
problem. Comparisons with general population data revealed lower TFI scores \
for the TFI subscales of \[OpenCurlyQuote]sense of control\[CloseCurlyQuote] \
and \[OpenCurlyQuote]intrusiveness\[CloseCurlyQuote] for professional \
musicians and higher for auditory difficulties associated with tinnitus \
amongst professional musicians. CONCLU-SION: Tinnitus can negatively impact \
on professional musicians\[CloseCurlyQuote] lives. There is a need for \
bespoke self-help groups, awareness raising, and education to prevent \
tinnitus and promote hearing health among musicians."}|>,

earplugs while performing affect the quality of the performance? Can \
listeners perceive a difference in sound when musicians are performing with \

some are reluctant to wear hearing protection due to factors such as an \
inability to hear their own instrument properly and the possibility of \
decreased sound quality for listeners. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study \
was to determine the effect of musicians\[CloseCurlyQuote] earplugs on \
instrumental pitch accuracy and the perception of tone quality, intonation, \
and dynamic contrast, as perceived by musicians and listeners. METHODS: Ten \
university studio faculty teachers were recorded performing single pitches \
and lyrical and technical passages, first without earplugs and then \
immediately after with earplugs. A sample of 8 studio faculty teachers and 88 \
undergraduate music education students completed a researcher-created music \
perception test of tone quality, intonation, and dynamic contrast. RESULTS: \
Objective analyses of the single pitch recordings made by faculty with and \
without earplugs indicate that pitch accuracy did not favor either condition \
consistently. Results from the perception test indicate that although both \
faculty and student listeners perceived some differences, the most frequent \
perception was that the audio pair was equal, and there was no clear \
difference between performing with and without earplugs in terms of tone \
quality, intonation, or dynamic contrast. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest \
that musicians should feel confident that wearing musicians\[CloseCurlyQuote] \
earplugs while performing does not adversely affect pitch accuracy or \
listeners\[CloseCurlyQuote] perceptions of their timbre and dynamic control. \

is to amplify sounds to compensate for hearing loss. The initial goal is to \
amplify speech and facilitate speech understanding especially in noise. \
Research shows that wireless hearing aids are efficacious for older adults , \
and in general, an increase in satisfaction and substantial benefits are \
characteristic for the wireless hearing aids brought to market during in the \
last decade. Music is proven to enhance the lives of older people, but many \
people report a reduction in their ability to enjoy music with a hearing \
loss. Amplification can be used to overcome a hearing impairment and return \
the joy of music to those with hearing loss. However, for listening to music \
or particularly, for musicians that play an instrument, the hearing aid \
settings used for amplifying speech often have adverse effects on music. \
Amplification and signal processing within hearing aids are designed to \
mainly improve speech understanding. It is possible to model the acoustical \
characteristics of speech because they are defined by the human vocal tract \
characteristics and the articulation speed. This acoustical model of speech \
is then used as a guideline for optimizing signal processing within the \
hearing aid. This approach has shown limitations in terms of perceived sound \
quality when listening to recorded or live music due to the characteristics \
of music which show more variations than speech in terms of frequency range, \
sound level, modulation, and dynamic range. These differences suggest that a \
specific listening program should be used when music is present in the \
listening environment. The need to offer a music program for musicians and \
music enthusiasts is also motivated by 1) the prevalence of hearing loss and \
associated audiological symptoms among musicians or music listeners exposed \
to high sound levels (and 2) the benefit (social, cognitive, and physical) of \
playing or listening to music especially for hearing impaired and seniors. An \
optimization procedure based on the participation of the musician during the \
fitting procedure showed promising results in terms of preference when \
playing music and in discrimination thresholds of level, duration, and pitch. \
However, this procedure targets only musicians who actively play music and \
requires time, some specific knowledge, and the possibility to make the \
adjustments in the fitting room. A new fitting rationale dedicated to music \
was therefore developed and made available in the fitting software. This new \
music rationale can be offered to any hearing aid user who wants an optimal \
listening experience when playing or listening to music (live, over a \
playback setup, or streaming from wireless device). The new music rationale \
is programmed based on the hearing loss and uses different gain shaping and \
kneepoints in the dynamic compression compared to the general listening \
program. Specific settings of signal processing features like directionality, \
noise reduction, or feedback cancellation are either turned off or set at a \
lower level than in the general listening program. For this study, Bernafon \
AG will carry out testing with participants that are musicians with hearing \
loss to test the new music rationale. The current study will compare the \
standard listening program to the music program based on the new rationale. \
The Bernafon hearing aids used for the current study are CE\[Hyphen] marked \
and the family of hearing aids have been on the market for almost one year. \
The hardware used for this test will be released in early 2022. The goal is \
to determine whether musicians will perceive a difference and prefer a music \
program over the general listening program when listening or playing music in \
real\[Hyphen]life situations and to validate the performance of the hardware \
style before release to the market. The devices used for the trial are the \
Bernafon Alpha 9 mBTE and as the control device, the Bernafon Viron 9 \
miniRITE (MNR) behind\[Hyphen]the\[Hyphen]ear (BTE) hearing aids. The results \
of the trial will be used to examine differences in the benefit provided by \
the two programs as well as identify further optimization possibilities or \
new risks associated with the devices. Objective measures will be made with \
Real Ear Measures (REM) to verify the output of the hearing aids, and \
subjective differences will be measured with questionnaires, an adaptive \
music perception test, and a forced choice AB listening preference test. All \
participants are hearing impaired persons that play an instrument. The trial \
will consist of a total of 2 appointments. For the field testing and the lab \
testing, the order of the test programs (music or standard) will be \
randomized. It is expected that the music program will perform better than \
the general listening program for perception and preference testing. In \
summary, the primary goal of this study is to evaluate the performance of a \
music program based on a new rationale and to validate the performance of the \
devices before the release of a new style to the market."}|>,

abilities decline with age, and one of the most commonly reported hearing \
difficulties reported in older adults is a reduced ability to understand \
speech in noisy environments. Older adult musicians have an enhanced ability \
to understand speech in noise, and this has been associated with enhanced \
brain responses related to both speech processing and the deployment of \
attention; however, the causal impact of music lessons in older adults has \
not yet been demonstrated. To investigate whether a causal relationship \
exists between short\[Hyphen]term musical training and performance on \
auditory tests in older adults and to determine if musical training can be \
used to improve hearing in older adult nonmusicians, we conducted a \
longitudinal training study with random assignment. A sample of older adults \
was randomly assigned to learn to play piano (Music), to learn to play a \
visuospatially demanding video game (Video), or to serve as a \
no\[Hyphen]contact control (No\[Hyphen]contact). After 6 months, the Music \
group improved their ability to understand a word presented in loud \
background noise, whereas the other 2 groups did not. This improvement was \
related to an increase in positive\[Hyphen]going electrical brain activity at \
fronto\[Hyphen]left electrodes 200\[Hyphen]1000 ms after the presentation of \
a word in noise. Source analyses suggest that this activity was due to \
sources located in the left inferior frontal gyrus and other regions involved \
in the speech\[Hyphen]motor system. These findings support the idea that \
musical training provides a causal benefit to hearing abilities. Importantly, \
these findings suggest that musical training could be used as a foundation to \
develop auditory rehabilitation programs for older adults."}|>},

hearing loss in classical musicians. DESIGN--Comparison of hearing levels \
between two risk groups identified during the study by measuring sound \
levels. SETTING--Symphony orchestra and occupational health department in the \
west Midlands. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Hearing level as measured by clinical \
pure tone audiometry. RESULTS--Trumpet and piccolo players received a noise \
dose of 160% and 124%, respectively, over mean levels during part of the \
study. Comparison of the hearing levels of 18 woodwind and brass musicians \
with 18 string musicians matched for age and sex did not show a significant \
difference in hearing, the mean difference in the hearing levels at the high \
(2, 4, and 8 KHz) audiometric frequencies being 1.02 dB (95% confidence \
interval -2.39 to 4.43). CONCLUSIONS--This study showed that there is a \
potential for occupational hearing loss in classical orchestral musicians.    \

   Suggestions              The purpose of this study was to examine the \
incidence of hearing problems reported from a heterogeneous group of \
musicians as a function of both primary performance area and primary \
instrument. Information for the investigation was obtained from the \
University of North Texas Musician Health Survey that allows musicians to \
report medical problems via the World Wide Web. Data were generated from a \
question regarding the presence or absence of hearing loss. The respondents \
were grouped according to primary performance area, according to primary \
instrument, and by primary instrument relative to whether they were classical \
or non-classical musicians. Results showed that 21.7% of the 3,292 musicians \
responding perceived having a problem with hearing. Findings showed the \
highest rate of occurrence was in rock/alternative musicians; in musicians \
who were included in the nonclassical grouping; and in musicians who played \
amplified instruments, drum-set, and primary brass instruments. Implications \
for further research and risk management are discussed.         No Reference \

   "AB" -> "Individuals with sensorineural hearing loss have difficulty \
understanding speech, especially in background noise. This deficit remains \
even when audibility is restored through amplification, suggesting that \
mechanisms beyond a reduction in peripheral sensitivity contribute to the \
perceptual difficulties associated with hearing loss. Given that \
normal-hearing musicians have enhanced auditory perceptual skills, including \
speech-in-noise perception, coupled with heightened subcortical responses to \
speech, we aimed to determine whether similar advantages could be observed in \
middle-aged adults with hearing loss. Results indicate that musicians with \
hearing loss, despite self-perceptions of average performance for \
understanding speech in noise, have a greater ability to hear in noise \
relative to nonmusicians. This is accompanied by more robust subcortical \
encoding of sound (e.g., stimulus-to-response correlations and response \
consistency) as well as more resilient neural responses to speech in the \
presence of background noise (e.g., neural timing). Musicians with hearing \
loss also demonstrate unique neural signatures of spectral encoding relative \
to nonmusicians: enhanced neural encoding of the speech-sound's fundamental \
frequency but not of its upper harmonics. This stands in contrast to previous \
outcomes in normal-hearing musicians, who have enhanced encoding of the \
harmonics but not the fundamental frequency. Taken together, our data suggest \
that although hearing loss modifies a musician's spectral encoding of speech, \
the musician advantage for perceiving speech in noise persists in a \
hearing-impaired population by adaptively strengthening underlying neural \
mechanisms for speech-in-noise perception.     Previous article in issue Next \

   "AB" -> "Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) has been extensively studied in \
industrial work environments. With the advent of new technologies, loud music \
has been increasingly affecting listeners outside of the industrial setting. \
Most research on the effects of music and hearing loss has focused on \
classical musicians. The purpose of the current study was to examine the \
relationship between the amount of experience a professional pop/rock/jazz \
musician has and objective and subjective variables of the musician's hearing \
loss. This study also examined professional pop/rock/jazz \
musicians\[CloseCurlyQuote] use of hearing protection devices in relation to \
the extent of their exposure to amplified music. Forty-four pop/rock/jazz \
musicians were interviewed using the Pop/Rock/Jazz Musician's Questionnaire \
(PRJMQ) in order to obtain self-reported symptoms of tinnitus and \
hyperacusis. Forty-two of the subjects were also tested for air-conduction \
hearing thresholds in the frequency range of 1-8 kHz. Results show that the \
extent of professional pop/rock/jazz musicians\[CloseCurlyQuote] exposure to \
amplified music was related to both objective and subjective variables of \
hearing loss: Greater musical experience was positively linked to higher \
hearing thresholds in the frequency range of 3-6 kHz and to the subjective \
symptom of tinnitus. Weekly hours playing were found to have a greater effect \
on hearing loss in comparison to years playing. Use of hearing protection was \
not linked to the extent of exposure to amplified music. It is recommended \
that further research be conducted with a larger sample, in order to gain a \
greater understanding of the detrimental effects of hours playing versus \
years playing."}, {"DB" -> "Google Scholar",

special vocational importance in musicians. Musical performance may create \
sounds sufficiently intense to cause sensorineural hearing loss. Although \
such losses are usually not severe enough to be compensable under American \
Academy of Otolaryngology guidelines for occupational hearing loss, they may \
interfere with the musician's ability to perform the daily tasks of his or \
her profession. A review of the literature on occupational hearing loss in \
musicians reveals a substantial need for further research.       \[Copyright] \

undertaken to quantify hearing thresholds in a large sample of percussionists \
and to evaluate factors that might increase or decrease a percussionist's \
risk for music-induced hearing loss. Audiometric and musical history data \
were collected from 315 percussionists attending the Percussive Arts Society \
International Convention in Louisville, Kentucky, in November 2004. Hearing \
thresholds for percussionists were compared to an age- and gender-matched, \
otologically normal reference population. Results indicate that hearing \
thresholds of percussionists are significantly worse than those of their age- \
and gender-matched peers, although differences appear to be small. Hearing \
was worse in the left ear of percussionists. The prevalence of hearing loss \
was 39% in percussionists vs. 9% in the reference population. Factors \
identified as increasing the risk for hearing loss included using \
amplification systems, playing rock/pop music, having more years of \
experience, and considering oneself a professional. Increased playing time \
and playing classical or jazz music were not found to increase a \
percussionist's risk for hearing loss. Benefits of wearing hearing protection \
devices (HPDs) were observed only for individuals who used foam earplugs when \
practicing. It is recommended that percussionists not only use HPDs and \
decrease practice and performance intensity levels but also participate in \
annual audiologic evaluations, including otoacoustic emission testing, to \
prevent music-induced hearing loss.         No Reference information \

common causes of sensorineural hearing loss. The prevention of NIHL in \
musicians requires a better understanding of its contributing exposure \
factors. We aimed to determine typical sound exposure levels received by \
professional musicians during solitary practice and calculate the maximum \
safe practice time (MSPT) for the main Iranian musical instruments.        \
Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study on 185 professional musicians \
(147 men and 38 women) between April 2018 and April 2019. The MSPT was \
calculated for each instrument if the mean sound level was below 85 dB in all \
musicians, and the music was considered a safe instrument; if it was >85 dB, \
it was considered a high-risk instruments and some other instruments had \
different mean sound level (in some participants <85 dB and some other \
players >85 dB), so these instruments were considered as borderline \
instruments.        Results: The mean age of the participants was 36.66 \
\[PlusMinus] 0.85 years and their mean daily practice time was 2.89 \
\[PlusMinus] 0.13 hours. The daily practice was significantly higher in \
plucked string instruments as compared to other instruments ( p <0.001). The \
mean sound level of every instrument varied from 67.77 to 100.77 dB in the \
right ear and 67.20 to 100.12 dB in the left ear. The highest sound level was \
in sorna and the lowest one in zanburak.       Conclusion: It seems musicians \
observe the MSPT of each instrument as much as possible. It is recommended to \
determine the comprehensive protocol for each instrument to prevent hearing \
loss in musicians."}, {"DB" -> "Google Scholar",

from our group that attempts to relate noise exposure and hearing thresholds \
in active performing musicians of the National Ballet of Canada Orchestra.    \
 Materials and Methods:     Exposures obtained in early 2010 were compared to \
exposures obtained in early 2017 (the present study). In addition, \
audiometric thresholds obtained in early 2012 were compared to thresholds \
obtained in early 2017 (the present study). This collection of measurements \
presents an opportunity to observe the regularities in the patterns of \
exposure as well as threshold changes that may be expected in active \
orchestra musicians over a 5-year span.     Results:     The pattern of noise \
exposure across instrument groups, which was consistent over the two time \
points, reveals highest exposures among brass, percussion/basses, and \
woodwinds. However, the average noise exposure across groups and time was \
consistently below 85 dBA, which suggests no occupational hazard. These \
observations were corroborated by audiometric thresholds, which were \
generally (a) in the normal range and (b) unchanged in the 5-year period \
between measurements.     Conclusion:     Because exposure levels were \
consistently below 85 dBA and changes in audiometric thresholds were minimal, \
we conclude that musicians experienced little-to-no risk of noise-induced \
hearing loss."}, {"DB" -> "Google Scholar",

objectives of this study were to: (1) estimate the hearing status of \
classical symphony orchestra musicians and (2) investigate the hypothesis \
that occupational sound exposure of symphony orchestra musicians leads to \
elevated hearing thresholds.   Design:       The study population comprised \
all the musicians from five symphony orchestras. Questionnaires were filled \
in by 337 subjects, and 212 subjects performed an audiometric test. For a \
group of 182 musicians (363 ears) the results of the audiometry was analyzed \
in relation to the individual exposure, which was estimated on the basis of \
sound measurements and questionnaire data regarding the exposure time. The \
mean hearing threshold at the frequencies 3, 4, and 6 kHz, corrected for age \
and sex, was used as outcome.   Results:       The musician ears with the \
highest exposure (29 of 363) had an additional threshold shift of 6.3 dB \
compared with the 238 ears with lowest exposure. The observed hearing loss of \
musicians was smaller compared with the noise -induced permanent threshold \
shift (NIPTS) predicted from ISO1999. A remaining confounding effect of age \
after ISO7029 age corrections could be observed to explain the difference in \
observed and predicted NIPTS. However, the observed hearing loss difference \
between the left and the right ear of musicians was 2.5 dB (95% confidence \
interval 1.5\[Dash]3.6), which was similar to the NIPTS predicted from \
ISO1999. Most of the musicians had better hearing at 3, 4, and 6 kHz for age \
than expected, however, 29 ears with the highest exposure above 90.4 dBA with \
a mean exposure time of 41.7 years had significantly elevated hearing \
thresholds. Trumpet players and the left ear of first violinists had \
significantly elevated hearing thresholds compared with other musicians .   \
Conclusion:       Most of the symphony orchestra musicians had better hearing \
than expected but they had a work-related risk of developing additional noise \
-induced hearing loss . The additional NITPS of the left ear compared with \
the right ear was at the expected level based on the cumulated sound exposure \
and ISO1999, indicating that performing music may induce hearing loss to the \
same extent as industrial noise .                         Professional \
symphony orchestra musicians are exposed to loud sounds from music, but it is \
still debated whether musicians are at increased risk of noise induced \
hearing loss . Professional symphony orchestra musicians \[CloseCurlyQuote] \
hearing thresholds were investigated and compared to the sound exposure to \
explore the relation between sound exposure and hearing loss among \
professional symphony orchestra musicians . Most of the symphony orchestra \

bctheses/24/items/1.0401903", "AB" -> "Purpose: Hidden hearing loss, also \
known as cochlear synaptopathy, describes auditory deficits in individuals \
with clinically normal hearing sensitivity in the conventional frequency \
range (250\[Dash]8000 Hz) which include difficulty understanding speech in \
background noise. Individuals with central auditory processing disorder \
report similar complaints. We aimed to investigate the utility of a central \
auditory processing test battery, the Multiple Auditory Processing Assessment \
(MAPA), as a potential diagnostic tool for hidden hearing loss. An additional \
objective was exploration of the link between noise exposure and hidden \
hearing loss. Previous studies on mice have found a reduction in hair cell \
synaptic connections subsequent to noise exposure. Design: Three groups of \
participants completed the MAPA: a control group (n = 24), a musician group \
(n = 20), and a symptomatic group (n = 11). The control group had young \
individuals with normal hearing (\[LessEqual] 25 dB HL thresholds at \
250\[Dash]8000 Hz) and no significant history of noise exposure, the musician \
group had young students with normal hearing who were considered to be at \
high risk for noise exposure due to their studies, and the symptomatic group \
had individuals with normal hearing who reported difficulties in challenging \
listening environments. Lifetime noise exposure was estimated using the Noise \
Exposure Structured Interview (NESI), and Bayesian logistic regression was \
used to model the relationship between the outcomes of MAPA subtests and \
noise exposure history. Results: The symptomatic group exhibited poorer \
performance on the MAPA compared to the control and musician groups. A \
right-ear advantage for all groups was apparent on several measures. The \
musician group had higher estimated lifetime noise exposure compared to the \
other groups. With the exception of the dichotic advantage score, NESI scores \
did not predict performance on the MAPA. Conclusion: Consistent with their \
reported difficulties, the symptomatic group performed more poorly on the \
MAPA. Despite their higher estimated lifetime noise exposure, no \
noise-induced central auditory processing deficits emerged in the musician \
group. Future studies should include older musicians with more lifetime noise \
exposure, and adjust for age effects by using a longitudinal study design or \
by age-matching across participant groups.           Item Metadata            \

                 Abstract     The objective of this research was to study \
musicians' abilities to estimate the risk to obtain a hearing loss. \
Twenty-two professional musicians mainly playing classical music wore \
dosimeters during 2 working weeks. They also wrote a diary describing all \
their musical activities and tried to judge the percentage of time that every \
activity was harmful to their hearing. Half of the musicians seemed to be \
capable to reasonably judge the harmfulness of the music that they were \
exposed to. They started to judge the levels to be risky at 80 dB(A) and \
regarded themselves as sligthly more susceptible to noise induced hearing \
loss than normal."}, {"DB" -> "Google Scholar", "TI" -> "The Influence of \

auditory-perceptual and acoustic effects of the semioccluded vocal tract \
exercise with Finnish tube on the vocal quality of a deaf musician.     \
Methods     A seven-day protocol with Finnish tube was performed with \
guidance for its home replication twice a day. A 46-years-old man with \
profound bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, musician and composer \
participated. Before and after the application of the protocol had undergone \
tonal audiometry , nasofibrolaryngoscopy, acoustic analysis with Praat and \
auditory-perceptual evaluation of the voice with Voice Profile Analysis \
Scheme for Brazilian Portuguese.     Results     The postintervention \
auditory-perceptual analysis identified reduction of the deviation in lip \
spreading, extensive labial range, raised tongue body, pharyngeal expansion, \
nasal resonance, larynx height, larynx and vocal tract tension and \
irregularity, pitch, speech rate, and a better respiratory support . The \
maximum phonation time reduced, probably because of elimination of the abrupt \
vocal attack and tension, articulatory deviations, improvement in voicing and \
the absence of the use of expiratory reserve air. The fundamental frequency \
became lower, and the first, second, third, and fourth formants became \
higher. The jitter increased, and the shimmer reduced.     Conclusion     The \
use of the Finnish tube might have facilitated the voicing sensations in the \
deaf musician, by enhancing the tactile-kinesthetic perception of the vocal \
tract and brought a greater source-filter interaction.          Section \

musicians of professional symphony orchestras. Main questions are: (1) Should \
musicians be treated as a special group with regard to hearing, noise, and \
noise related hearing problems (2) Do patterns of hearing damage differ for \
different instrument types (3) Do OAE have an added value in the diagnosis of \
noise induced hearing loss (NIHL) in musicians. Methods     241 professional \
musicians, aged between 23\[Dash]64 participated. A brief medical history and \
the subjective judgment of their hearing and hearing problems were assessed. \
Musicians were subjected to an extensive audiological test battery, which \
contained testing of audiometric thresholds, loudness perception, diplacusis, \
tinnitus, speech perception in noise, and otoacoustic emissions. Results     \
Most musicians could be categorized as normal hearing, but their audiograms \
show notches at 6\[NonBreakingSpace]kHz, a frequency that is associated with \
NIHL. Musicians often complained about tinnitus and hyperacusis, while \
diplacusis was generally not reported as a problem. Tinnitus was most often \
localized utmost left and this could not be related to the instrument. It was \
usually perceived in high frequency areas, associated with NIHL. In general, \
musicians scored very well on the speech-in-noise test. The results of the \
loudness perception test were within normal limits. Otoacoustic emissions \
were more intense with better pure-tone thresholds, but due to large \
individual differences it can still not be used as an objective test for \
early detection of NIHL. Conclusions     Musicians show more noise induced \
hearing loss than could be expected on the basis of age and gender. Other \
indicators, such as complaints and prevalence of tinnitus, complaints about \
hyperacusis and prevalence of diplacusis suggest that \
musicians\[CloseCurlyQuote] ears are at risk. Continuing education about the \
risks of intensive sound exposure to musicians, with the emphasis on the \
possible development of tinnitus and hyperacusis and the need for good \
hearing protection is warranted.                             Working on a \

 Introduction          Noise induced hearing loss (NIHL) is caused by \
repeated exposure to loud sounds over an extended period of time, exposure to \
very loud impulse sound(s), or a combination of both. Individuals of all \
ages, including children, adolescents, young adults, and older people, can \
develop NIHL, while exposed to intense sounds in the workplace, in \
recreational settings, or at home. Among the working population who could be \
affected by NIHL, members of professional symphony orchestras are a specific \
group for two reasons: they are fully dependent on their hearing for their \
profession, and they are frequently exposed to loud music. Besides, they have \
a complicated relation to preventive measures, such as wearing ear muffs or \
using protective screens, as they may be accompanied by the loss of"},

musicians with hearing loss show improvements in speech understanding in a \
background of noise, but by self\[Hyphen]report do not perceive an advantage \

musicians aged 42\[Hyphen]64 with a perceived hearing loss. Scores on a \
variety of assessments were compared to published normative data and a survey \
was also completed. No significant differences were found between the \
musicians and the normative data. Survey responses indicated that overall, \
the musician participants did not have concerns with hearing themselves play \
music or with how well they hear music in general. Participants did report \
concerns with hearing in background noise, room acoustics, following \
conversation, and noise exposure from music. Participants also noted \
occasional difficulty in noise, reverberant environments, and when visual \
cues are lacking. These findings suggest that musicians may have unique \
concerns related to their hearing, even if their perceived handicap secondary \
to hearing loss is no larger than would be expected based on their hearing \
loss alone                           Additional Files         Gebel_Poster \

perhaps the norm and the problem of maintaining a full musical life in the \
face of increasing deafness is all too familiar. Up until \
Beethoven\[CloseCurlyQuote]s well documented life we know relatively little \
about the response musicians made to deafness. Thomas Mace (c. \
1613\[Dash]1706) lost his hearing in middle age, yet continued his musical \
life as a player, singer and teacher. In response to his disability he \
modified his instruments to help him hear, devised an acoustical performing \
chamber to enhance the sound potential of an enclosed space, and invented new \
instruments. Mace\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Musick\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Monument \
(1676) is the most important English source of lute music after 1640 and he \
was one of the most important music theorists of the period. His discussion \
of \[OpenCurlyQuote]affect\[CloseCurlyQuote] in music is invaluable. This \
chapter explores the ways that hearing loss affected his thinking on music \
and the practical steps he took to continue his musical life. Mace was an \
inspirational to the author as a fellow deaf lutenist and is still relevant \
to today\[CloseCurlyQuote]s musicians.          Taylor & Francis Group Logo   \

slight alterations in their hearing will have a significant impact on their \
performance ability as musicians. Although the effect of orchestra music on \
hearing is documented, existing researches have several drawbacks, and in \
most studies measurement of musical sound exposure is not linked to \
audiological test results. Some variables that may have a significant \
influence on resulting hearing loss are not taken into consideration. The \
literature review shows a confusing picture, and some studies identify \
high-frequency notches suggestive of noise induced threshold shift while \
others suggest musicians\[CloseCurlyQuote] hearing levels are not \
significantly different from a non-exposed population. There are strict legal \
requirements for the daily noise exposure a worker can receive in workplace \
but nothing to regulate non-occupational noise and music exposure. This \
research work sets out to study the effects of playing in an orchestra on \
various age groups of musicians, to identify important variables that may \
potentially contribute to resulting hearing loss, and how playing in an \
orchestra or a band affects children in particular. In this study 37 out of \
61 adult musicians (61%), 19 out of 85 youth musicians (22%) and six out of \
37 children musicians (16%) were found to have a hearing loss. The sound \
exposure measurements confirm that there is an increased risk for hearing \
loss of all ages and the majority of musicians are also exposed to high \
impulse noise with the peak level of above 140dB. There is a broad individual \
difference in sensitivity and vulnerability. It is often difficult to \
estimate total sound exposure for every musician. Individual susceptibility \
seems to depend on known and unknown factors and interaction between \
intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Personal ear protection devices are seldom \
used among the musicians. Hence this study stresses the importance of an \
individualised hearing conservation programme that includes identifying all \
potential variables/factors that may increase the risk. This thesis addresses \
the development of hearing loss in orchestra musicians, audio logical \
findings among players of different musical instruments, and methods of \
effective hearing conservation programmes for preventing hearing loss in \
musicians.             Date 2011         Author         Sivaraj, \

collegiate musicians have towards using high-fidelity hearing protection. The \
participants were members of Texas State\[CloseCurlyQuote]s athletic bands. \
The musicians engaged in an educational intervention that incorporated \
dosimeter sound level percentages, distortion product otoacoustic emissions \
testing, and a video from Etymotic\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Adopt-A- Band hearing \
conservation program. Each musician was issued high-fidelity hearing \
protection and educated on its proper use. Pre-study and post-study surveys \
were conducted to determine how attitudes and behaviors toward the prevention \
of NIHL changed over time. Findings showed all band members felt that optimum \
sound quality was worth the increased risk of hearing loss. However, all \
subjects reported they would continue wearing the earplugs after learning of \
its importance.           Citation   Johnson, C. L. (2016). Avoiding the \

Approximately 4000 new cases of sudden hearing loss (SHL) occur annually in \
the United States, and 15,000 annually worldwide, accounting for \
approximately 1% of all cases of SHL. Although prevalence studies do not \
necessarily distinguish between idiopathic and acquired SHL, most cases of \
spontaneous SHL have no identifiable cause. In this article, the authors \
assess the cause, history, diagnosis, and treatment of SHL.          \

                               Abstract          \[Bullet] Noise-induced \
hearing loss (NIHL) is well reported among devotees of rock 'n' roll music, \
but less attention has been focused on players of orchestral music. Sound \
pressure levels have been recorded from within orchestras during \
performances, and audiometry has been carried out on orchestral musicians. \
Short-lasting peaks of sound of high amplitude were found to occur, and some \
players had audiometric changes consistent with NIHL. However, in practice, \
there seemed to be no threat to the players' continued livelihood, although \
the additive effect of presbyacusis in later life poses a potential problem. \
The difficulties of prevention of NIHL and the attenuation of the high sound \
levels of orchestras do not seem to be completely soluble.     ( Arch \

exposure of faculty musicians at a university music department, specifically \
for hearing loss prevention purposes. Sound measurements were obtained as a \
major portion of the project to calculate the risk for over-exposure to \
hazardous sound intensities. Excessive sound exposure can cause permanent \
injury to the human auditory system. This type of injury is diagnostically \
classified as noise-induced hearing loss and tinnitus. To verify \
risk-exposure status, dosimeters were used to sample a variety of accessible \
musician training environments. Sound samples obtained from personal noise \
dosimetry instrumentation were used to obtain common noise metrics, such as \
A-weighted decibel (dBA) intensity level, time-weighted average, and peak \
sound pressure level. During group rehearsals and private lessons, our \
measurements indicated that faculty musicians were exposed to sound levels in \
excess of 85dBA (the damage-risk criterion level used by most countries, \
except the United States). At times, students and faculty were exposed to \
sound intensities in excess of 90dBA. These surveillance samples were plotted \
and interpreted to provide appropriate recommendations for faculty musicians. \
To deliver hearing-loss prevention to all workers affected by hazardous \
sound, our national policies, hearing conservation programs, and \
hearing-health wellness should be revised and mandated for professional \
musicians.                 Recommended Citation        Mahon, Hannah and \

   Suggestions              While there are many causes of hearing loss, many \
of which have nothing to do with exposure to loud noises, noise (or \
music)-induced hearing loss is theoretically preventable 100% of the time. \
Loss of hearing is typically a major problem if it happens to dancers and \
actors, but it is catastrophic for musicians. Thus, it is not surprising that \
this topic has been covered extensively in Medical Problems of Performing \
Artists, starting with \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Musician and Occupational \
Sound Hazards\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] by Hart et al. in volume 2, over 20 \
years ago. Without duplicating the content of those articles, this editorial \
will try to determine why this remains a somewhat controversial topic in the \

   "AB" -> ":       Noise induced hearing loss (NIHL) is prevalent amongst \
musicians and can have a debilitating influence on their musical careers and \
quality of life. The prevention of NIHL in musicians is challenging because \
of their need to hear music precisely. The use of earplugs is the most \
practical protective measure against NIHL. However, reported usage rates are \
poor. Amongst New Zealand musicians, little is known about their hearing \
health and use of noise reduction strategies. The aim of this research was to \
explore hearing loss, earplug use and sound exposure in New Zealand \
musicians. Methods: A short online questionnaire assessed selfreport measures \
related to NIHL in 81 musicians. Dosimetry measurement of sound levels was \
then conducted for seven days with a subset of 6 musicians. Audiometric \
testing involving measurement of otoacoustic emissions, pure tone audiometry, \
extended high frequency audiometry and real ear at threshold individual \
earplug fit testing was then undertaken with these 6 musicians. Findings: The \
prevalence of self-reported hearing loss was found to be 43.2%. Additionally, \
17.7% of musicians always experienced tinnitus and 66.3% of musicians \
perceived hazardous sound exposure during performances. Reported earplug use \
was 46.9% and inconsistent across musical situations. Numerous barriers to \
earplug use were identified. Amongst the 6 musicians, dosimetry measures \
revealed a substantial risk of NIHL and fit training was demonstrated to \
improve the earplug attenuation achieved. Conclusion: The high prevalence of \
hearing issues and widespread difficulties associated with earplug use \
supports the need for the development of hearing conservation strategies for \
the musician population in New Zealand.           Description:       Full \

          2020 marks the 250th anniversary of Ludwig van Beethoven's \
birthday. The composer's hearing impairment is probably the most well-known \
disorder of a musician. For more than 200 years, the underlying cause of his \
deafness has been studied, but still not fully understood. In this context, \
the question arises as to how far the currently available measures of hearing \
rehabilitation would made it possible for the musician to receive \
satisfactory treatment.       On the basis of primary sources, such as \
letters from the composer, written documents from his contemporaries and, in \
particular, Beethoven's detailed autopsy report and subsequent clinical \
examinations of his skull, the development of his hearing impairment is \
examined, the most likely causes are evaluated and classified in the context \
of further illnesses.       In the differential diagnosis, syphilis, chronic \
lead intoxication, osteodystrophia deformans, otosclerosis, and autoimmune \
inflammation of the inner ear are discussed as possible causes of hearing \
impairment of the musician.       In the course of the discussion, the \
existing studies on the individual differential diagnoses are presented and \
critically classified in terms of their justifiability and relevance. In \
addition, the potential benefit of a cochlear implantation is estimated for \
the composer.         Poster-PDF   A-2005.PDF           #         Prv.-Doz. \

   "AB" -> ":       BACKGROUND AND AIM : Musical training has been \
hypothesised to result in enhanced Speech Perception in Noise (SPIN) \
abilities, but prolonged exposure to music also increases the risk for \
Music-Induced Hearing Loss (MIHL). The Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNR) and the \
Extended High Frequency (EHF) thresholds between formally trained musicians \
and non- musicians were compared to determine the effect of musical training \
on musicians\[CloseCurlyQuote] SPIN and hearing abilities. METHODS : This \
cross-sectional study included 40 musicians and 39 non-musicians 18\[Dash]30 \
years, with mean age (SD) 22.43(2.71) years. EHF audiometry and the \
Digits-in-Noise (DIN) test were conducted via a smartphone. RESULTS : \
Differences found between the two groups regarding the DIN test and EHF \
thresholds were statistically insignificant. Musicians displayed early signs \
of MIHL as the musicians reported significantly more (p=0.004) instances of \
tinnitus than non-musicians. A statistically significant correlation was \
found only for the non-musician group between the 12.5 kHz threshold left and \
the SNR obtained in the diotic listening condition (rs=-0.465; p=0.003). \
CONCLUSION : The results suggested that musicians did not display a \
significant advantage for SPIN and did not appear to have significantly \
poorer EHF hearing sensitivity. However, slight trends were noticeable in the \
musicians which gravitated more towards studies that found enhanced SPIN \
abilities and elevated EHF thresholds in the musician population. In the \
future, it may be useful to include additional speech tests (open-set) \
alongside the DIN test (closed-set). The present study suggests that EHF \
audiometry may be used for the early detection of MIHL.                 Show \

This thesis discusses the underrepresented issue of noise-induced hearing \
loss (NIHL) in the classical music environment, focusing on strategies for \
improving the hearing safety of students and faculty in a school of music \
setting. In this thesis, national sound safety standards are addressed in \
relationship to data found at other universities. Using basic principles of \
sound, several suggestions are made to help lessen potentially dangerous \
sounds stemming from various musical environments. The goal of this research \
is to lay the ground work for the development and implementation of a hearing \
conservation program at Texas State University's School of Music. This \
research, however, may easily be applied to many other music programs, with \
the potential to help preserve the hearing of generations of musicians as \
good habits for hearing health are encouraged.           Citation   Wade, A. \

   "AB" -> "Background       Many studies have examined the perception of \
musical emotion using excerpts from familiar music that includes highly \
expressed emotions to classify emotional choices. However, using familiar \
music to study musical emotions in people with acquired hearing loss could \
produce ambiguous results as to whether the emotional perception is due to \
previous experiences or listening to the current musical stimuli. To overcome \
this limitation, we developed new musical stimuli to study emotional \
perception without the effects of episodic memory.         Methods       A \
musician was instructed to compose five melodies with evenly distributed \
pitches around 1 kHz. The melodies were created to express the emotions of \
happy , sad , angry , tender , and neutral . To evaluate whether these \
melodies expressed the intended emotions, two methods were applied. First, we \
classified the expressed emotions of melodies with selected musical features \
from 60 features using genetic algorithm-based k -nearest neighbors. Second, \
forty-four people with normal hearing participated in an online survey \
regarding the emotional perception of music based on dimensional and discrete \
approaches to evaluate the musical stimuli set.         Results       \
Twenty-four selected musical features produced classification for intended \
emotions with an accuracy of 76%. The results of the online survey in the \
normal hearing (NH) group showed that the intended emotions were selected \
significantly more often than the others. K-means clustering analysis \
revealed that melodies with arousal and valence ratings corresponded to \
representative quadrants of interest. Additionally, the applicability of the \
stimuli was tested in 4 individuals with high-frequency hearing loss.         \
Conclusion       By applying the individuals with NH, the musical stimuli \
were shown to classify emotions with high accuracy, as expressed. These \
results confirm that the set of musical stimuli can be used to study the \
perceived emotion in music, demonstrating the validity of the musical \
stimuli, independent of innate musical bias such as due to episodic memory. \
Furthermore, musical stimuli could be helpful for further studying perceived \
musical emotion in people with hearing loss because of the controlled pitch \
for each emotion.             Graphical Abstract"},

   Suggestions              Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is a major \
health problem that affects an estimated 16.1% of American adults, but for \
musicians, the onset of noise-induced, or any type of hearing loss, can be a \
career-changing event. The potential for dangerous sound pressure levels in \
musical environments has been documented in numerous studies, with exposures \
in both short and long durations shown to be harmful. Yet, in theory, NIHL is \
completely preventable. This review discusses basic information concerning \
the hearing mechanism and NIHL, audiometry, standards, protective strategies, \
and terminology. It aims to provide a general understanding of these \
processes as they relate to musicians and other performing artists.         \

                         To celebrate the 250th anniversary of the birth of \
the great classical composer, Ludwig van Beethoven (1770\[Dash]1827), we \
point out how his hearing loss affected him and how the primitive hearing \
aids at that time helped mitigate his hearing loss. From the age of 26, \
Beethoven began to suffer from a fluctuating, progressive hearing loss \
(\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]my hearing grew worse and \
worse\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]), This started in his left ear \
(\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]in my left ear, with which this illness of my ears \
had started\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]), where he had difficulty hearing higher \
pitched tones (\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t hear the high \
notes of the instruments and voices\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]) and words \
(\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Sometimes, I cannot hear people who speak quietly, I \
can hear the sounds, but not the words\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]) and \
associated with tinnitus (\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]my ears, they still keep \
buzzing and humming day and night\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]) and loudness \
recruitment (\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]if someone yells, it is unbearable to \
me\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]).       However, in spite of his hearing loss, \
Beethoven never lost his love for music and continued composing music, at \
times using some of the"}, {"DB" -> "Google Scholar",

Finally, the third purpose was to determine if the type of protection used, \
standard or custom, impacted wearing time. Hearing threshold sensitivity, \
tympanometry, and use of hearing protection were measured prior to the \
fitting of the custom earmolds and again at the end of the marching season.   \
    Pre-season results indicated that the majority of band members reported \
they did not wear standard ear protection for practice and performances. The \
reasons for lack of consistent use of hearing protection with standard plugs \
were comfort, forgetting to wear hearing protection, perception of volume, \
and quality of sound.       Most participants who did not consistently wear \
the earmolds stated that fit, comfort, and perception of volume were the main \
reasons for inconsistent wear. Overall, provision of custom earmolds was \
associated with increased number of RMB members who wore ear protection as \
well as increased wearing time overall."}, {"DB" -> "Google Scholar",

music if we cannot hear it properly? The achievements of deaf musicians \
suggest it is possible not only to perceive music, but to perform with other \
musicians. Yet very little research exists to explain how this is possible. \
This thesis addresses this problem and explores the premise that vibrations \
felt on the skin may facilitate interactive music making. An initial \
interview study found that, while vibrations are sometimes perceived, it is \
predominantly the use of visual and physical cues that are relied upon in \
group performance to help stay in time and in tune with other players. The \
findings informed the design of two observation studies exploring the effects \
of i) artificial attenuation of auditory information and ii) natural deafness \
on performance behaviours. It was shown that profound congenital deafness \
affected the players\[CloseCurlyQuote] movements and their gazes/glances \
towards each other while mild or moderate levels of attenuation or deafness \
did not. Nonetheless, all players, regardless of hearing level, reciprocated \
the behaviours of co-performers suggesting the influence of social factors \
benefitting verbal and non-verbal communication between players. Finally, a \
series of three psychophysical experiments was designed to explore the \
perception of pitch on the skin using vibrations. The first study found that \
vibrotactile detection thresholds were not affected by hearing impairments. \
The second established that the relative pitches of intervals larger than a \
major 6th were easy to discriminate, but this was not possible for semitones. \
The third showed that tones an octave apart could be memorised and identified \
accurately, but were confused when less than a perfect 4th apart. The thesis \
concludes by evaluating the potential of vibrotactile technology to \
facilitate interactive performance for musicians with hearing impairments. By \
considering the psychophysical, behavioural and qualitative data together, it \
is suggested that signal processing strategies in vibrotactile technology \
should take social, cognitive and perceptual factors into account.            \

   Suggestions              The occurrence of noise-induced hearing loss \
(NIHL) can be detrimental to the future careers of student musicians. Few \
studies have focused on the noise exposure of student musicians within an \
indoor pep band as they performed during university basketball games. The \
purpose of this longitudinal study was to assess: (a) the status of noise \
dosages acquired via personal noise dosimeters from two pep band players as \
they performed over nine men\[CloseCurlyQuote]s basketball games spanning \
three seasons, (b) perceived effectiveness of earplugs on the primary \
participants, and (c) the status of all band members\[CloseCurlyQuote] (n=72) \
knowledge of hearing loss and hearing loss prevention. The noise dosages \
accrued by primary participants in each game over the three seasons greatly \
exceeded the National Institute for Occupational Safety and \
Health\[CloseCurlyQuote]s (NIOSH) recommendation regarding safe daily noise \
exposure time. Participants occasionally reported that the earplugs did not \
provide sufficient protection from noise or contributed to communication and \
intonation issues. Questionnaire responses from band members demonstrated a \
mild deficiency in hearing loss knowledge. Two-thirds of pep band members \
reported that they did not always wear hearing protection at pep band \
functions. Exceeding standard noise dosage recommendations without hearing \
protection potentially leaves these individuals at a high risk for permanent \
hearing loss.         No Reference information available - sign in for \

                                        Abstract     In the present study, we \
evaluated peripheral and central auditory pathways in professional musicians \
(with and without hearing loss) compared to non-musicians. The goal was to \
verify if music exposure could affect auditory pathways as a whole. This is a \
prospective study that compared the results obtained between three groups \
(musicians with and without hearing loss and non-musicians). Thirty-two male \
individuals participated and they were assessed by: Immittance measurements, \
pure-tone air conduction thresholds at all frequencies from 0.25 to 20 kHz, \
Transient Evoked Otoacoustic Emissions, Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR), \
and Cognitive Potential. The musicians showed worse hearing thresholds in \
both conventional and high frequency audiometry when compared to the \
non-musicians; the mean amplitude of Transient Evoked Otoacoustic Emissions \
was smaller in the musicians group, but the mean latencies of Auditory \
Brainstem Response and Cognitive Potential were diminished in the musicians \
when compared to the non-musicians. Our findings suggest that the population \
of musicians is at risk for developing music-induced hearing loss. However, \
the electrophysiological evaluation showed that latency waves of ABR and P300 \
were diminished in musicians, which may suggest that the auditory training to \
which these musicians are exposed acts as a facilitator of the acoustic \
signal transmission to the cortex."}, {"DB" -> "Google Scholar",

impact of musicians professional and private life. The objectives of the \
study were therefore to: (1) describe the epidemiology of tinnitus including \
its severity in classical orchestra musicians, (2) investigate the \
association between tinnitus severity in classical musicians and their \
cumulative lifetime sound exposure, and (3) the association between tinnitus \
and hearing thresholds.     Design:     The study population included all \
musicians from five Danish symphony orchestras. Answers regarding their \
perception of tinnitus were received from 325 musicians, and 212 musicians \
were also tested with audiometry. Any tinnitus and severe tinnitus were two \
definitions of tinnitus used as outcomes and analyzed in relation to an \
estimation of the cumulative lifetime sound exposure from sound measurements \
and previously validated questionnaires and the average hearing threshold of \
3, 4, and 6\[ThinSpace]kHz.     Results:     Thirty-five percentage of all \
musicians (31% female and 38% of male musicians) reported having experienced \
at least one episode of tinnitus lasting for more than 5 minutes during their \
life. Severe tinnitus with a severe impact on daily life was reported by 19% \
of the musicians (18% of female and 21% of male musicians). The severity of \
tinnitus was associated with increased lifetime sound exposure but not to \
poorer high frequency hearing thresholds when the lifetime sound exposure was \
considered. The odds ratio for an increase in one unit of tinnitus severity \
was 1.25 (95% CI, 1.12\[Dash]1.40) for every 1 dB increase in lifetime sound \
exposure.     Conclusion:     Musicians frequently report tinnitus. Any \
tinnitus and severe tinnitus are significantly associated with the cumulative \
lifetime sound exposure, which was shown to be the most important factor not \
only for the prevalence but also for the severity of tinnitus\[LongDash]even \
in musicians without hearing loss. High-frequency hearing thresholds and \
tinnitus severity were correlated only if the cumulative lifetime sound \
exposure was excluded from the analyses."}, {"DB" -> "Google Scholar",

   Suggestions              We reviewed 13 papers on noise exposure of \
orchestral musicians and found that the question of whether orchestra \
musicians are overexposed does not appear to have a clear answer. To find \
relevant papers, we researched three databases (Scholar, Scopos, and \
Medline), which yielded 6, 9, and 17 papers, respectively (including \
duplicates). A number of papers in the reviewed literature lacked basic \
descriptions concerning such issues as measurement technique and \
instrumentation. Rough data and calculation details were often not provided \
so that the conclusions could not be checked easily. The most serious problem \
was the estimated time that musicians performed in the orchestra. This \
information is crucial for the calculation of the normalized noise exposure \
levels (L EX ), and is especially important as orchestra players do not \
perform year-round nor are they exposed to the same noise levels while \
performing different pieces of music.         No Reference information \

Royal College of Music (RCM). Audiogram data taken from 162 students (86 F, \
76 M; mean age=23.7 years, SD=4.8) showed a statistically significant notch \
at 6 kHz in the left ear, indicative of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL), \
but no significant notch was found in the right. Noise exposure asymmetry did \
not appear to account for notch asymmetry as trombone and trumpet players \
showed evidence of the same left notch trend as lateralized instruments such \
as violin and viola players. The earliest audiometric indicator of impending \
NIHL for musicians may be a developing hearing threshold notch at 6 kHz in \
the left ear.                                        Preview     Text       \

                               Abstract          ROCK AND ROLL music is \
generally considered to be very loud, particularly by persons over 25 years \
of age. There have been several references in the popular literature recently \
which have hypothesized that the intensity of the music leads to hearing \
loss. 1,2 Reported estimates of the intensity of rock and roll music have \
ranged from 120 to 130 db. A primary impetus to this investigation was the \
appearance of numerous references in newspaper articles and other types of \
mass media concerning the \"damaging effects of rock and roll music on \
hearing.\" Since the persons who have the most contact with this music \
probably are the musicians, one can assume that if rock and roll music \
produced hearing loss it would be most readily seen among the musicians \
themselves. Further, in order to meaningfully interpret pure-tone thresholds \
(PTT) obtained from the musicians, it is important to know something about \

Supplementary Data    Suggestions              Hearing threshold and survey \
data collected over 3 years in a university school of music indicate that 52% \
of undergraduate music students show declines in high-frequency hearing at \
6000 Hz consistent with acoustic overexposure. Declines at 4000 Hz have grown \
in number over the 3 years, from 2% the first year to 30% in the third year. \
These \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]noise notches\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] are seen \
in all instrument groups, including voice, and are seen more in the right ear \
than the left ear in all groups. Exposure to outside noise does not appear to \
be a determining factor in who develops these declines. It is concluded that \
genetic predisposition is a likely risk factor.         No Reference \

          OBJECTIVE: College musicians exhibit greater declines in hearing \
than the general population and are at particular risk because they rehearse \
and perform daily in loud environments. Also, they engage in use of personal \
listening devices which increases the amount of \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]exposure\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] time. Despite \
increased risk, many do not use hearing protection devices (HPD). The purpose \
of this study was to (1) to identify the present level of education about \
hearing health, (2) identify the perceived advantages and disadvantages of \
using HPD, and (3) evaluate results among different musical instrument \
groups. METHODS: A mixed-methods group design was used including both \
quantitative and qualitative instruments. SPSS was used to generate \
descriptive statistics, and non-parametric statistical analysis was performed \
on quantitative data. NVivo software was used to evaluate qualitative \
responses. RESULTS: Of the 90 college instrumental music students who \
participated, 12% reported a history of hearing loss, and over one-third \
reported tinnitus. Seventy-seven percent of participants had never received \
any training about hearing health and only a small percentage of students \
used HPD. The most cited reason for lack of protection use was its negative \
impact on sound quality. However, group differences were noted between brass, \
woodwind, and percussion musicians in terms of HPD uptake. CONCLUSION: \
Improving the type of information disseminated to college musicians may \
reduce the risk of ear-related deficits. Noise dosage information, HPD \
information, and prevention education grounded in theories like the Health \
Belief Model may increase awareness and promote greater use of HPDs in this \
population.         No Reference information available - sign in for access.  \

study was to assess hearing status in professional orchestral musicians. \
Standard pure-tone audiometry (PTA) and transient-evoked otoacoustic \
emissions (TEOAEs) were per- formed in 126 orchestral musicians. Occupational \
and non-occupational risk factors for noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) were \
identified in questionnaire inquiry. Data on sound pressure levels produced \
by various groups of instruments were also collected and analyzed. Measured \
hearing threshold levels (HTLs) were compared with the theoretical \
predictions calculated according to ISO 1999 (1990). Musicians were exposed \
to excessive sound at weekly noise exposure levels of for 81\[Dash]100 dB \
(mean: 86.64.0 dB) for 5\[Dash]48 years (mean: 24.010.7 years). Most of them \
(95%) had hearing corresponds to grade 0 of hearing impairment (mean hearing \
threshold level at 500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 Hz lower than 25 dB). However, \
high frequency notched audiograms typical for noise-induced hearing loss were \
found in 35% of cases. Simultaneously, about 35% of audiograms showed typical \
for NIHL high frequency notches (mainly occurring at 6000 Hz). When analyzing \
the impact of age, gender and noise exposure on hearing test results both PTA \
and TEOAE consistently showed better hearing in females vs. males, younger \
vs. older musicians. But higher exposure to orchestral noise was not \
associated with poorer hearing tests results. The musician\[CloseCurlyQuote]s \
audiometric hearing threshold levels were poorer than equivalent \
non-noise-exposed population and better (at 3000 and 4000 Hz) than expected \
for noise-exposed population according to ISO 1999 (1990). Thus, music \
impairs hearing of orchestral musicians, but less than expected from noise \
exposure."}, {"DB" -> "Google Scholar", "TI" -> "Sound Exposure \

improved fundamental frequency ( F 0 ) discrimination for young listeners \
with normal hearing (NH). It is unclear whether a comparable effect of \
musical training occurs for listeners whose sensory encoding of F 0 is \
degraded. To address this question, the effect of musical training was \
investigated for three groups of listeners (young NH, older NH, and older \
listeners with hearing impairment, HI). In a first experiment, F 0 \
discrimination was investigated using complex tones that differed in harmonic \
content and phase configuration (sine, positive, or negative Schroeder). \
Musical training was associated with significantly better F 0 discrimination \
of complex tones containing low-numbered harmonics for all groups of \
listeners. Part of this effect was caused by the fact that musicians were \
more robust than non-musicians to harmonic roving. Despite the benefit \
relative to their non-musicians counterparts, the older musicians, with or \
without HI, performed worse than the young musicians. In a second experiment, \
binaural sensitivity to temporal fine structure (TFS) cues was assessed for \
the same listeners by estimating the highest frequency at which an interaural \
phase difference was perceived. Performance was better for musicians for all \
groups of listeners and the use of TFS cues was degraded for the two older \
groups of listeners. These findings suggest that musical training is \
associated with an enhancement of both TFS cues encoding and F 0 \
discrimination in young and older listeners with or without HI, although the \
musicians\[CloseCurlyQuote] benefit decreased with increasing hearing loss. \
Additionally, models of the auditory periphery and midbrain were used to \
examine the effect of HI on F 0 encoding. The model predictions reflected the \
worsening in F 0 discrimination with increasing HI and accounted for up to \
80\[NonBreakingSpace]% of the variance in the data.                           \

                  INTRODUCTION            The effects of musical training on \
fundamental frequency ( F 0 ) discrimination have been largely investigated \
for young listeners with normal hearing (NH). Behavioral studies have shown \
that young NH musicians are two to six times more sensitive than \
non-musicians in complex-tone F 0 discrimination (e.g., Micheyl et al. 2006 ; \
Bianchi et al. 2016a ). Neuroimaging and electrophysiological studies have \
reported training-dependent plasticity in NH musicians at both cortical \
(Pantev et al. 1998 ; Schneider et al. 2002 ; Hyde et al. 2009 ; Foster and \
Zatorre 2010 ; Bianchi et al. 2017b ) and subcortical stages (Musacchia et \
al. 2007 ; Wong et al. 2007 ; Parbery-Clark et al. 2009 ) of the auditory \
system. However, little is known about the effects of musical training for \
older listeners with or without hearing impairment. There is some evidence \
suggesting that musical training in the aging population leads to improved"},

1996 by mail from a random sample of a musicians\[CloseCurlyQuote] union \
list, by face-to-face interview during music club jobs in Dallas, Texas, or \
at a music conference in New Orleans, Louisiana. The findings from sample 2 \
are generally limited to N-MS and MS problems that affected performance in \
the previous year, health habits, and some health-related attitudes. Basic \
findings for sample 1 were as follows: 26% cited a current medical problem, \
49% had at least one N-MS problem, 74% had at least one MS problem, and 42% \
reported hearing loss. In sample 2, 37% of the musicians reported hearing \
loss. Overall percentages for N-MS and MS problems for sample 2 were not \
available, but percentages for specific problems are delineated. Depression \
and anxiety were among the most frequently cited N-MS problems for both \
samples. Pain and stiffness were the most frequently reported MS problems for \
both samples. Ten percent of sample 1 musicians and 16% of sample 2 musicians \
indicated that alcohol or drug use had hurt their performance in the previous \
year. More than half of the musicians in sample 1 and sample 2 had health \
insurance, but most obtained it through non-music-related jobs or family \
coverage. Although the generalizability of the findings is limited \
significantly by the nonrandom nature of the samples and generally low \
response rates, this study nonetheless contributes provisional information on \
popular musicians\[CloseCurlyQuote] health status. The findings are compared \
with other musician samples where possible, including some previously \
unpublished health findings from the University of North Texas \
Musicians\[CloseCurlyQuote] Health Survey on the Internet. Specific concerns \
and strategies for future research on popular musicians\[CloseCurlyQuote] \

This article considers the impact of vision and hearing loss on great \
painters and musical composers. The visual work of Mary Cassatt, Georgia \
O'Keeffe, Edgar Degas, and Claude Monet\[NonBreakingSpace]all showed \
alterations as their vision failed. In contrast, Gabriel Faur\[EAcute], \
Bed\[RHacek]ich Smetana, and Ludwig von Beethoven wrote many of their best \
compositions while totally deaf, and Georg Friedrich Handel and Frederick \
Delius struggled to compose late in life when they lost their vision \
(although their hearing remained excellent). There are 2 major distinctions \
between the role of vision and hearing for these artistic disciplines. First, \
there is a surrogate means of \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]hearing\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] music, through the \
musical score, which allows composers to write and edit music while totally \
deaf. The greatest problem with deafness for a skilled composer is \
interference from internal noise (tinnitus). There is no surrogate for vision \
to allow a painter to work when the subject is a blur or the colors on the \
canvas cannot be distinguished. Second, although the appreciation of art is \
visual and that of music is auditory, the transcription of both art and \
musical composition is visual. Thus, visual loss does pose a problem for a \
composer accustomed to working with good sight, because it disrupts habitual \
methods of writing and editing music.          Section snippets Painters with \
Visual Impairment     Total blindness makes the creation of visual art \
virtually impossible, but many artists have struggled to continue their work \
with partial visual loss. Stylistic changes in an artist's work often are \
made for personal and aesthetic reasons, and generally should not be used to \
diagnose eye disease. 1 However, when serious visual loss is present, its \
effect usually is evident in an artist's work. Some examples of changing \
style are discussed below and are illustrated for Degas and Monet with \
Composers with Deafness     Total deafness from birth would preclude an \
appreciation of music as it is usually defined. However, several famous \
composers developed hearing loss later in life.     Bed\[RHacek]ich Smetana \
(1824\[Dash]1884) had hearing loss that came on rather quickly in 1874, \
possibly after an infection, although not necessarily the neurosyphilis that \
ended his life. 7 He became totally deaf, but the greatest handicap to \
composing was persistent tinnitus.8, 9, 10 He told a friend that \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]written music . . . comes to life in my Composers with \
Visual Loss     It is useful to distinguish between composers who are blind \
early in childhood and those with blindness acquired late in life. Compose"},

commercially available hearing protectors were worn, all commonly used during \
leisure-time music exposure. Four of them were augmented premolded earplugs \

30 min each, participants not professionally involved in music wore one \
particular type of protector. Contemporary club music was played at sound \
pressure levels (SPLs) representative of concerts and bars. After each \
listening session, a questionnaire on sound quality and general appreciation \
was completed. In addition, otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) were measured \
directly before and after music exposure. The reported appreciation clearly \
differed depending on the addressed characteristics and the specific earplug \
type. In this test group, the reported appreciation mainly depended on \
comfort and looks, while differences in sound quality were less noticeable. \
The changes in OAE amplitude before and after noise exposure were small in \

   Suggestions              Percussionists can be exposed to intermittent \
sound stimuli that exceed 145 dB SPL, although damage may occur to the outer \
hair cells at levels of 120 dB SPL. The present study measured \
distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) in a group of 86 \
normal-hearing percussionists and 39 normal-hearing nonpercussionists. \
Results indicate that normal-hearing percussionists have lower DPOAE \
amplitudes than normal-hearing nonpercussionists. DPOAE amplitudes were \
significantly lower at 6000 Hz in both the left and right ears for \
percussionists. Percussionists also more frequently had absent DPOAEs, with \
the greatest differences occurring at 6000 Hz (absent DPOAEs in 25% of \
percussionists vs 10% of nonpercussionists). When all frequencies are \
considered as a group, 33% of the percussionists had an absent DPOAE in \
either ear at some frequency, compared to only 23% of the nonpercussionists. \
Otoacoustic emissions are more sensitive to outer hair cell damage than \
pure-tone threshold measurements and can serve as an important measurement of \
sensory loss (i.e., outer hair cell damage) in musicians before the person \
perceives the hearing loss. DPOAE monitoring for musicians, along with \
appropriate education and intervention, might help prevent or minimize \
music-induced hearing loss.         No Reference information available - sign \

   Suggestions              Student musicians are at risk for noise-induced \
hearing loss (NIHL) as they develop skills and perform during instructional \
activities. Studies using longitudinal dosimeter data show that pedagogical \
procedures and instructor behaviors are highly predictive of NIHL risk, thus \
implying the need for innovative approaches to increase instructor competency \
in managing instructional activities without interfering with artistic and \
academic freedom. Ambient information systems, an emerging trend in \
human-computer interaction that infuses psychological behavioral theories \
into technologies, can help construct informative risk-regulating systems. \
The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of introducing an \
ambient information system into the ensemble setting. The system used two \
ambient displays and a counterbalanced within-subjects treatment study design \
with six jazz ensemble instructors to determine if the system could induce a \
behavior change that alters trends in measures resulting from dosimeter data. \
This study assessed efficacy using time series analysis to determine changes \
in eight statistical measures of behavior over a 9-wk period. Analysis showed \
that the system was effective, as all instructors showed changes in a \
combination of measures. This study is in an important step in developing \
non-interfering technology to reduce NIHL among academic musicians.         \

regarding occurrences of hearing loss induced by noise from excessively \
amplified sound-producing activities within leisure and professional \
environments. Sound technicians' activities expose them to the risk of \
hearing loss, and consequently put at risk their quality of life, the quality \
of the musical product and consumers' hearing. The aim of this study was to \
measure the prevalence of high frequency hearing loss consistent with noise \
exposure among sound technicians in Brazil and compare this with a control \
group without occupational noise exposure. Methods     This was a \
cross-sectional study comparing 177 participants in two groups: 82 sound \
technicians and 95 controls (non-sound technicians). A questionnaire on music \
listening habits and associated complaints was applied, and data were \
gathered regarding the professionals' numbers of working hours per day and \
both groups' hearing complaint and presence of tinnitus. The participants' \
ear canals were visually inspected using an otoscope. Hearing assessments \
were performed (tonal and speech audiometry) using a portable digital AD 229 \
E audiometer funded by FAPESP. Results     There was no statistically \
significant difference between the sound technicians and controls regarding \
age and gender. Thus, the study sample was homogenous and would be unlikely \
to lead to bias in the results. A statistically significant difference in \
hearing loss was observed between the groups: 50% among the sound technicians \
and 10.5% among the controls. The difference could be addressed to high sound \
levels. Conclusion     The sound technicians presented a higher prevalence of \
high frequency hearing loss consistent with noise exposure than did the \
general population, although the possibility of residual confounding due to \
unmeasured factors such as socioeconomic status cannot be ruled out.          \
 Peer Review reports         Background          Music is ever present in our \
daily lives, establishing a link between human beings and the arts through \
the senses and pleasure. However, if we use music inappropriately, that is, \
if we make abusive use of the duration, intensity and/or frequency of \
exposure to music, the noise may have an adverse impact on our hearing \
function.     High frequency of hearing loss consistent with noise exposure \
(noise-induced hearing loss, NIHL), excluding cases of acute acoustic trauma, \
is characterized by the gradual and progressive loss of hearing acuity. NIHL \
occupies the second place among the most common hearing illnesses, only \
surpassed by presbyacusis [ 1 , 2 ].     In Brazil, noise has only been \
recognized as an ambient pollutant since March 1991 [ 3 ]. Epidemiological \

performance. Vibrotactile thresholds have been determined to assess the \
potential for vibrotactile presentation of music to the glabrous skin of the \
fingertip, forefoot and heel. No significant differences were found between \
the thresholds for sinusoids representing notes between C1 and C6 when \
presented to the fingertip of participants with normal hearing and with a \
severe or profound hearing loss. For participants with normal hearing, \
thresholds for notes between C1 and C6 showed the characteristic U-shape \
curve for the fingertip, but not for the forefoot and heel. Compared to the \
fingertip, the forefoot had lower thresholds between C1 and C3, and the heel \
had lower thresholds between C1 and G2; this is attributed to spatial \
summation from the Pacinian receptors over the larger contactor area used for \
the forefoot and heel. Participants with normal hearing assessed the \
perception of high-frequency vibration using 1s sinusoids presented to the \
fingertip and were found to be more aware of transient vibration at the \
beginning and/or end of notes between G4 and C6 when stimuli were presented \
10dB above threshold, rather than at threshold. An average of 94% of these \
participants reported feeling continuous vibration between G4 and G5 with \
stimuli presented 10dB above threshold. Based on the experimental findings \
and consideration of health effects relating to vibration exposure, a \
suitable range of notes for vibrotactile presentation of music is identified \
as being from C1 to G5. This is more limited than for human hearing but the \
fundamental frequencies of the human voice, and the notes played by many \
instruments, lie within it. However, the dynamic range might require \
compression to avoid the negative effects of amplitude on pitch perception.   \

Studies on prevalence of acquired hearing loss across the life span have \
shown a trend of increase in hearing loss with age. A parallel decline in age \
of recreational use of loud music and cigarette smoking suggests that these \
early listening and recreational habits may be major contributing factors to \
the chronic hearing disability seen in later years. In recognition of these \
new recreational patterns of adolescents and young adults, Healthy People \
2010 has issued a list of objectives for prevention of noise-induced hearing \
loss and smoking in adolescents and young adults through early education and \
intervention. In this article, the authors describe the effects of noise- and \
music-induced and smoking-induced hearing loss and provide guidelines for \
early identification and hearing conservation. Such an early approach to \
identification and conservation should ultimately help reduce hearing loss \
prevalence rates in adults.          Section snippets Prevalence     One of \
the first national, population-based, cross-sectional surveys conducted in \
the United States between 1988 and 1994 showed that 14.9% of children (n = \
6166) in the age range of 6 to 19 years experienced hearing loss. 4 Moreover, \
12.5% of these children exhibited high-frequency audiometric notches \
suggestive of noise damage, with the prevalence increasing with age and being \
greater in male participants as compared with female participants. 4 A \
further increase in the prevalence of hearing Prevalence     The most recent \
youth risk behavior survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and \
Prevention indicates that 18.7% of female students and 21.3% of male students \
in grades 9 through 12 smoked cigarettes at least 1 day during the past \
30\[NonBreakingSpace]days, whereas 7.4% of female students and 8.7% of male \
students smoked cigarettes on 20 days or more during the past 30 days. 17 \
Moreover, of the 20% who smoked cigarettes, 7.1% of female students and 13.8% \
of male students smoked more than 10 cigarettes          References (26)     \
