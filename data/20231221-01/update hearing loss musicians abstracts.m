{{"          Tinnitus is a heritable, highly prevalent auditory disorder \
treated by multiple medical specialties. Previous GWAS indicated high genetic \
correlations between tinnitus and hearing loss, with little indication of \
differentiating signals. We present a GWAS meta-analysis, triple previous \
sample sizes, and expand to non-European ancestries. GWAS in 596,905 Million \
Veteran Program subjects identified 39 tinnitus loci, and identified genes \
related to neuronal synapses and cochlear structural support. Applying \
state-of-the-art analytic tools, we confirm a large number of shared \
variants, but also a distinct genetic architecture of tinnitus, with higher \
polygenicity and large proportion of variants not shared with hearing \
difficulty. Tissue-expression analysis for tinnitus infers broad enrichment \
across most brain tissues, in contrast to hearing difficulty. Finally, \
tinnitus is not only correlated with hearing loss, but also with a spectrum \
of psychiatric disorders, providing potential new avenues for treatment. This \
study establishes tinnitus as a distinct disorder separate from hearing \
difficulties.     Similar content being viewed by others                      \

 {"          Loss of synapses between spiral ganglion neurons and inner hair \
cells (IHC synaptopathy) leads to an auditory neuropathy called hidden \
hearing loss (HHL) characterized by normal auditory thresholds but reduced \
amplitude of sound-evoked auditory potentials. It has been proposed that \
synaptopathy and HHL result in poor performance in challenging hearing tasks \
despite a normal audiogram. However, this has only been tested in animals \
after exposure to noise or ototoxic drugs, which can cause deficits beyond \
synaptopathy. Furthermore, the impact of supernumerary synapses on auditory \
processing has not been evaluated. Here, we studied mice in which IHC synapse \
counts were increased or decreased by altering neurotrophin 3 (Ntf3) \
expression in IHC supporting cells. As we previously showed, postnatal Ntf3 \
knockdown or overexpression reduces or increases, respectively, IHC synapse \
density and suprathreshold amplitude of sound-evoked auditory potentials \
without changing cochlear thresholds. We now show that IHC synapse density \
does not influence the magnitude of the acoustic startle reflex or its \
prepulse inhibition. In contrast, gap-prepulse inhibition, a behavioral test \
for auditory temporal processing, is reduced or enhanced according to Ntf3 \
expression levels. These results indicate that IHC synaptopathy causes \
temporal processing deficits predicted in HHL. Furthermore, the improvement \
in temporal acuity achieved by increasing Ntf3 expression and synapse density \
suggests a therapeutic strategy for improving hearing in noise for \
individuals with synaptopathy of various etiologies.              Citation: \

 {"     Background     Today, young people who listen to loud music, \
especially through headphones, are at an extremely high risk of noise-induced \
hearing loss. The aim of this study was to investigate how young \
people\[CloseCurlyQuote]s listening habits affect their hearing thresholds. A \
total of 88 young adults between the ages of 18 and 25 took part in the \
study, 44 of whom listened to music through headphones while the others did \
not. The control group was exposed to white noise at \
55\[Dash]65\[NonBreakingSpace]dB with the Interacoustic AC 40 Hybrid \
Audiometer, and people who did not use headphones and said they were not \
exposed to higher levels of sound than the given sample were included in the \
study. Participants were given a survey to assess their music listening \
preferences. One hundred twenty-five to 18,000\[NonBreakingSpace]Hz air \
conduction hearing thresholds were assessed for all participants. Results     \
When the pure tone thresholds of the groups were compared, the independent \
t-test showed that the thresholds of the study group were significantly worse \
than those of the control group. Bilaterally in the 4000\[NonBreakingSpace]Hz \
band and for the left ear in the 6000\[NonBreakingSpace]Hz band ( p \
<\[ThinSpace]0.05). There were also significant differences between the \
groups in the 14,000\[NonBreakingSpace]Hz and 16,000\[NonBreakingSpace]Hz \
bands in the right ear and the 14,000\[NonBreakingSpace]Hz, \
16,000\[NonBreakingSpace]Hz, and 18,000\[NonBreakingSpace]Hz bands in the \
left ear ( p <\[ThinSpace]0.05). Twenty-two participants reported listening \
to music at a high level, 16 participants at a moderate level, and 6 \
participants at a very high level. Conclusion     Although the hearing \
thresholds of the study group were worse than those of the control group in \
the 4000\[NonBreakingSpace]Hz, 6000\[NonBreakingSpace]Hz, \
14,000\[NonBreakingSpace]Hz, 16,000\[NonBreakingSpace]Hz, and \

Graphical abstract "}, {"     Background     The cochlear sympathetic system \
plays a key role in auditory function and susceptibility to noise-induced \
hearing loss (NIHL). The formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a \
well-documented process in NIHL. In this study, we aimed at investigating the \
effects of a superior cervical ganglionectomy (SCGx) on NIHL in \
Sprague-Dawley rats. Methods     We explored the effects of unilateral and \
bilateral Superior Cervical Ganglion (SCG) ablation in the eight-ten weeks \
old Sprague-Dawley rats of both sexes on NIHL. Auditory function was \
evaluated by auditory brainstem response (ABR) testing and Distortion product \
otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs). Outer hair cells (OHCs) counts and the \
expression of \[Alpha] 2A -adrenergic receptor (AR) in the rat cochlea using \
immunofluorescence analysis. Cells culture and treatment, CCK-8 assay, Flow \
cytometry staining and analysis, and western blotting were to explore the \
mechanisms of SCG fibers may have a protective role in NIHL. Results     We \
found that neither bilateral nor unilateral SCGx protected the cochlea \
against noise exposure. In HEI-OC1 cells, H 2 O 2 -induced oxidative damage \
and cell death were inhibited by the application of norepinephrine (NE). NE \
may prevent ROS-induced oxidative stress in OHCs and NIHL through the \
\[Alpha] 2A -AR. Conclusion     These results demonstrated that sympathetic \
innervation mildly affected cochlear susceptibility to acoustic trauma by \
reducing oxidative damage in OHCs through the \[Alpha] 2A -AR. NE may be a \
potential therapeutic strategy for NIHL prevention.                View this \

Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) occurs when the sensitive structures in the \
inner ear are damaged by loud sound. Exposure to workplace noise for 10 years \
or more increased the odds of having any kind of hearing loss by a ratio of \
2.4 and an increased risk ratio of 6.8 for moderate-to-severe hearing loss [ \
1 ]. Approximately 22\[NonBreakingSpace]million workers in the United States \
(US) are exposed to hazardous noise at work [ 2 ]. In China, \
it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s estimated that approximately \
80\[NonBreakingSpace]million workers exposed to hazardous noise [ 3 ].     \
Following superior cervical ganglionectomy (SCGx) the norepinephrine (NE) \
tissue levels were decreased after several hours [ 4 ]. The sympathetic \

aim of this study was to compare the effects of impulse/impact noise and \
continuous noise on hearing status.   Methods:       In this study, 259 \
workers referred to the occupational medicine clinic of Shahid Rahnemoun \
hospital, Yazd, Iran, entered the study and were divided into two groups: \
with exposure to impact/impulse noise and with exposure to continuous noise. \
Hearing thresholds were measured and compared between the two groups by \
pure-tone audiometry (PTA). The frequency of hearing loss and audiometric \
notch according to the results of PTA was compared between the two groups. \
Data were analyzed by SPSS (ver. 16) using Student\[CloseCurlyQuote]s t \
-test, Chi-square test, and Mann\[Dash]Whitney U test.   Results:       \
Hearing thresholds were significantly higher at all frequencies in the impact \
noise group. The hearing threshold at 6000 Hz was higher than other \
frequencies in both groups. The frequency of hearing loss at high frequencies \
was higher in the impact group. The frequency of audiometric notch was not \
significantly different between the two groups.   Conclusions:       The \
results of this study showed that hearing loss after exposure to \
impact/impulse noise is probably more frequent and more severe than exposure \
to continuous noise, but the pattern of hearing loss is similar in both types \
of noise exposure.           Introduction       One of the most frequent \

losses in adults (over 4 million DALYs) is attributed to occupational noise, \
ranging from 7% to 21% in the various sub-regions. [ 5 ]       \
Noise-producing equipment or devices may produce two kinds of noise: \
continuous or impact/impulse, which are different regarding physical \
characteristics. Most workers are exposed to continuous noise or a \
combination of continuous and impact/impulse noise, and less workers are \

revolutionized the management of profound hearing loss, with a growing focus \
on preserving residual hearing, particularly low-frequency hearing. This \
review synthesizes existing literature on cochlear implantation techniques, \
surgical principles, and emerging therapies aimed at reducing \
post-implantation hearing loss. Methodologically, a comprehensive narrative \
literature review was conducted, encompassing various study designs and \
participant demographics. The search strategy involved major biomedical \
databases, focusing on articles in English. Surgical techniques such as \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]soft surgery\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] emphasize \
minimizing mechanical stress on the cochlea, while advancements in \
pharmacological agents explore the use of corticosteroids, neurotrophins, and \
growth factors to enhance hearing preservation. Electrode design and \
insertion strategies are evolving to minimize trauma and optimize hearing \
outcomes, including consideration of insertion forces and electrode array \
designs. Evaluating residual hearing loss involves sophisticated techniques \
like electrocochleography and radiological imaging. The impact of residual \
hearing on auditory verbal outcomes is variable, with studies indicating \
positive correlations with language development, particularly in speech \
production. Emerging strategies in electrode design, surgical techniques, and \
drug delivery hold promise for improving outcomes in cochlear implantation. \
However, challenges such as the lack of standardized guidelines and the need \
for further clinical trials remain. Future directions include the exploration \
of nanotechnologies, gene therapies, and stem cells for constructing bionic \
ears, although ethical and technical hurdles persist. This review underscores \
the ongoing efforts to enhance cochlear implant functionality and the need \
for continued research to optimize outcomes for patients with hearing loss.   \

 {"           Objective       In previous animal studies, sound enhancement \
reduced tinnitus perception in cases associated with hearing loss. The aim of \

          1 "}, {"          High intensity noise exposure leads to a \
permanent shift in auditory thresholds (PTS), affecting both peripheral \
(cochlear) tissue and the central auditory system. Studies have shown that a \
noise-induced hearing loss results in significant cell loss in several \
auditory structures. Degeneration can be demonstrated within hours after \
noise exposure, particularly in the lower auditory pathway, and continues to \
progress over days and weeks following the trauma. However, there is limited \
knowledge about the effects of recurring acoustic trauma. Repeated noise \
exposure has been demonstrated to increase neuroplasticity and neural \
activity. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the influence of a \
second noise exposure on the cytoarchitecture of key structures of the \
auditory pathway, including spiral ganglion neurons (SGN), the ventral and \
dorsal cochlear nucleus (VCN and DCN, respectively), and the inferior \
colliculus (IC). In the experiments, young adult normal hearing mice were \
exposed to noise once or twice (with the second trauma applied one week after \
the initial exposure) for 3\[NonBreakingSpace]h, using broadband white noise \
(5 \[Dash] 20\[NonBreakingSpace]kHz) at 115\[NonBreakingSpace]dB SPL. The \
cell densities in the investigated auditory structures significantly \
decreased in response to the initial noise exposure compared to unexposed \
control animals. These findings are consistent with earlier research, which \
demonstrated degeneration in the auditory pathway within the first week after \
acoustic trauma. Additionally, cell densities were significantly decreased \
after the second trauma, but this effect was only observed in the VCN, with \
no similar effects seen in the SGN, DCN, or IC. These results illustrate how \
repeated noise exposure influences the cytoarchitecture of the auditory \
system. It appears that an initial noise exposure primarily damages the lower \

hearing loss (NIHL) has both negative economic and quality of life \
implications. The risk spine surgeons undertake in regards to NIHL during \
operative intervention is unknown. Governing bodies, including the National \
Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, have recommended exposure \
limits not to exceed 85 decibels (dB) over 8 hours. The purpose of this study \
is to characterize noise exposure to spine surgeons in the operating room \
(OR).     Methods     Prospective collection of intraoperative recordings of \
spinal surgeries (cervical and thoracic/lumbar) was undertaken. Data gathered \
included procedure, operative duration, presence of background music, and \
noise information. Noise information included maximum decibel level (MDL), \
Peak level (LCPeak), Equivalent continuous sound pressure level, time \
weighted average (TWA), dose, and projected dose. Noise measurements were \
compared with baseline controls with and without music (empty ORs).     \
Results     Two hundred seven noise recordings were analyzed. One hundred \
eighteen of those being spinal surgeries, 49 baseline recordings without \
music, and 40 with music. Maximum decibel level reached a maximum value of \
111.5 dBA, with an average amongst surgical recordings of 103 dBA. Maximum \
decibel level exceeded 85 dBA in 100% of cases and was greater than 100 dBA \
in 78%. The maximum LCPeak recorded was 132.9 dBC with an average of 120 dBC. \
Furthermore, the average dose was 7.8% with an average projected dose of \
26.5%. The highest dose occurred during a laminectomy at 72.9% of daily \
allowable noise. Maximum projected dose yielded 156% during a 3-level \
anterior cervical discectomy and fusion.     Conclusions     Spine surgeons \
are routinely exposed to damaging noise levels (>85 dBA) during operative \
intervention. With spine surgeons often performing multiple surgeries a day, \
the cumulative risk of noise exposure cannot be ignored. The synergistic \
effects of continuous and impact noise places spine surgeons at risk for the \
development of occupation-related NIHL.     Previous article in issue Next \

 {"           Music is an important part of life for many people. It can \
evoke a wide range of emotions, including sadness, happiness, anger, tension, \
relief and excitement. People with hearing loss and people with cochlear \
implants have reduced abilities to discriminate some of the features of \
musical sounds that may be involved in evoking emotions. This paper reviews \
these changes in perceptual abilities and describes how they affect the \
perception of emotion in music. For people with acquired partial hearing \
loss, it appears that the perception of emotion in music is almost normal, \
whereas congenital partial hearing loss is associated with impaired \
perception of music emotion. For people with cochlear implants, the ability \
to discriminate changes in fundamental frequency (associated with perceived \
pitch) is much worse than normal and musical harmony is hardly perceived. As \
a result, people with cochlear implants appear to judge emotion in music \
primarily using tempo and rhythm cues, and this limits the range of emotions \
that can be judged.       This article is part of the theme issue \

processing and emotional experience\[CloseCurlyQuote].            1. \
Introduction       In almost all societies, including isolated ones living in \
remote areas [ 1 ], music plays an important role. It enhances social \
interactions [ 2 ], gives pleasure [ 3 ], and can convey a wide range of \
emotions, including sadness, happiness, anger, tension, relief and excitement \
[ 4 ]. It seems likely that links between features of music and emotions are \
partly culturally based and depend on the form of music in a specific \
culture, such as the tonal scale used [ 1 , 2 , 5 ]. For example, in Western \
music, the major mode (e.g. the notes C, E, G) is associated with happy music \
while the minor mode (e.g. the notes C, Eb, G) is associated with sad music, \
but this association is not found for children aged below about 4 years [ 6 \
]. However, there are probably also features of music that influence emotion \
regardless of culture [ 7 , 8 ]. For example, a fast tempo is often \
associated with happy music while a slow tempo is associated with sad music, \
and dynamic variations may convey excitement or expressiveness, whereas a \
lack of dynamic variations conveys calmness [ 9 ]. For a study of the \
acoustic features that influence the perception of emotion in music, see \
Coutinho & Dibben [ 10 ].       People with normal hearing usually perceive \
emotions in music easily and without effort. However, a substantial \
proportion of the adult population, about 20%, has some degree of hearing \
loss, and hearing loss becomes increasingly prevalent with increasing age [ \
11 ]. The most widely used measure of hearing is the pure-tone audiogram, \
which assesses the lowest sound level at which sinusoids of different \
frequencies can be detected [ 12 ]. The detection thresholds are expressed \
relative to the average values for young people with no known hearing \
problems and "}, {"       Abstract 1       ", StringTake[" 2       ", 24]}, 
 {"          Exposure to brief, intense sound can produce profound changes in \
the auditory system, from the internal structure of inner hair cells to \
reduced synaptic connections between the auditory nerves and the inner hair \
cells. Moreover, noisy environments can also lead to alterations in the \
auditory nerve or to processing changes in the auditory midbrain, all without \
affecting hearing thresholds. This so-called hidden hearing loss (HHL) has \
been shown in tinnitus patients and has been posited to account for hearing \
difficulties in noisy environments. However, much of the neuronal research \
thus far has investigated how HHL affects the response characteristics of \
individual fibres in the auditory nerve, as opposed to higher stations in the \
auditory pathway. Human models show that the auditory nerve encodes sound \
stochastically. Therefore, a sufficient reduction in nerve fibres could \
result in lowering the sampling of the acoustic scene below the minimum rate \
necessary to fully encode the scene, thus reducing the efficacy of sound \
encoding.     Here, we examine how HHL affects the responses to frequency and \
intensity of neurons in the inferior colliculus of rats, and the duration and \
firing rate of those responses. Finally, we examined how shorter stimuli are \
encoded less effectively by the auditory midbrain than longer stimuli, and \
how this could lead to a clinical test for HHL.     Previous article in issue \
Next article in issue          "}, {"          Hearing loss is the most \
important factor in the development of tinnitus. This chapter describes the \
changes that occur in the central auditory system as a consequence of hearing \
loss. Deprivation of input to the auditory system can cause two types of \
functional changes: it can alter the balance between inhibition and \
excitation, and it can activate neuronal plasticity. Any type of hearing \
loss, such as conductive or sensorineural hearing loss, results in decreased \
input to the central auditory nervous system. Noise-induced hearing loss is \
an example of auditory deprivation and overuse, which in turn can activate \
neural plasticity. An altered balance between inhibition and excitation can \
change the gain in the central auditory system. If the gain is increased, \
this can lead to hyperactivity in the form of tinnitus. The effects on the \
balance between inhibition and excitation may subside when normal input to \
the auditory system occurs. However, activation of neuronal plasticity that \
may occur as a result of sensory stimulation may persist even after normal \
sensory stimulation is restored. Plastic changes may become permanent, and \
reversal of neuronal plasticity may require special measures.          Aage \

References       "}, {"          Plasticity occurs at various time scales. In \
addition to neuronal spike-firing adaptation at a relatively short time \
scale, central neural responses can be decreased over much longer time \
periods, e.g., as in habituation. In particular, spectrotemporal receptive \
fields might have slower timescales of adaptation on the order of minutes to \
hours. A common hypothesis is that tinnitus results from a maladaptive \
imbalance between excitation and inhibition as a result of downregulation of \
inhibitory amino acid neurotransmission in the central auditory pathway. \
However, the effects of neural plasticity underlying noise exposure do not \
need to be maladaptive because the chronic tinnitus percept may be the result \
of experience-dependent plasticity with a percept engrained in memory as a \
result of continuous attention to it. Plastic changes in the adult auditory \
system do occur following noise exposure, from traumatic to environmental, \
causing permanent hearing loss, temporary loss, or no audiometric hearing \
loss. Tonotopic map changes are not required for tinnitus to occur; however, \
tonotopic maps in people with hearing loss without tinnitus were \
significantly different from those with normal hearing, whereas the maps of \
people with hearing loss and tinnitus were not. These results corroborate \
that map reorganization is a characteristic of hearing loss, not of tinnitus. \
It further raises the possibility that the spontaneous activity underlying \
tinnitus may prevent cortical map changes.                    This is a \

acoustic injury has been met with many translational challenges, resulting in \
the absence of FDA-approved interventions. Localized hypothermia following \
noise exposure mitigates acute cochlear injury and may serve as a potential \
avenue for therapeutic approaches. However, the mechanisms by which \
hypothermia results in therapeutic improvements are poorly understood.       \
Methods: This study performs the transcriptomic analysis of cochleae from \
juvenile rats that experienced noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) followed by \
hypothermia or control normothermia treatment.       Results: Differential \
gene expression results from RNA sequencing at 24\[ThinSpace]h post-exposure \
to noise suggest that NIHL alone results in increased inflammatory and immune \
defense responses, involving complement activation and cytokine-mediated \
signaling. Hypothermia treatment post-noise, in turn, may mitigate the acute \
inflammatory response.       Discussion: This study provides a framework for \
future research to optimize hypothermic intervention for ameliorating hearing \
loss and suggests additional pathways that could be targeted for NIHL \
therapeutic intervention.            1 Introduction       Acoustic injury \
produces a multifaceted response in the auditory system that corresponds to \
the extent and nature of the noise insult. Given the lack of FDA-approved \
otoprotectants, the time course of noise-induced mechanical and molecular \
injury and repair in the cochlea is being increasingly studied to identify \
viable otopro"}, {"          Understanding the complex pathologies associated \
with hearing loss is a significant motivation for conducting inner ear \
research. Lifelong exposure to loud noise, ototoxic drugs, genetic diversity, \
sex, and aging collectively contribute to human hearing loss. Replicating \
this pathology in research animals is challenging because hearing impairment \
has varied causes and different manifestations. A central aspect, however, is \
the loss of sensory hair cells and the inability of the mammalian cochlea to \
replace them. Researching therapeutic strategies to rekindle regenerative \
cochlear capacity, therefore, requires the generation of animal models in \
which cochlear hair cells are eliminated. This review discusses different \
approaches to ablate cochlear hair cells in adult mice. We inventoried the \
cochlear cyto- and histo-pathology caused by acoustic overstimulation, \
systemic and locally applied drugs, and various genetic tools. The focus is \
not to prescribe a perfect damage model but to highlight the limitations and \
advantages of existing approaches and identify areas for further refinement \
of damage models for use in regenerative studies.     Previous article in \

 {"          Chronic tinnitus is a debilitating condition with very few \
management options. Acoustic trauma that causes tinnitus has been shown to \
induce neuronal hyperactivity in multiple brain areas in the auditory \
pathway, including the inferior colliculus. This neuronal hyperactivity could \
be attributed to an imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory \
neurotransmission. However, it is not clear how the levels of \
neurotransmitters, especially neurotransmitters in the extracellular space, \
change over time following acoustic trauma and the development of tinnitus. \
In the present study, a range of amino acids were measured in the inferior \
colliculus of rats during acoustic trauma as well as at 1 week and 5 months \
post-trauma using in vivo microdialysis and high-performance liquid \
chromatography. Amino acid levels in response to sound stimulation were also \
measured at 1 week and 5 months post-trauma. It was found that unilateral \
exposure to a 16\[NonBreakingSpace]kHz pure tone at 115\[NonBreakingSpace]dB \
SPL for 1\[NonBreakingSpace]h caused immediate hearing loss in all the \
animals and chronic tinnitus in 58\[NonBreakingSpace]% of the animals. \
Comparing to the sham condition, extracellular levels of GABA were \
significantly increased at both the acute and 1 week time points after \
acoustic trauma. However, there was no significant difference in any of the \
amino acid levels measured between sham, tinnitus positive and tinnitus \
negative animals at 5 months post-trauma. There was also no clear pattern in \
the relationship between neurochemical changes and sound frequency/acoustic \
trauma/tinnitus status, which might be due to the relatively poorer temporal \
resolution of the microdialysis compared to electrophysiological responses.   \

Title Abstract ", " :       Low- (or mild-) gain hearing aids (LGHAs) are \
increasingly considered for individuals with normal peripheral hearing but \
significant self-reported hearing difficulties (SHDs). This study assesses \
the benefits of LGHAs as a management option for individuals with normal \
hearing thresholds (NHTs) and SHDs, comparing LGHA use and benefit to \
individuals with non-significant hearing difficulties (NHDs) and those with \
peripheral hearing loss. Questionnaires addressing hearing aid usage, \
benefit, hearing difficulties, and tinnitus were administered to 186 \
individuals who self-identified as hearing aid users in a sample of 6652 \
service members who were receiving their annual hearing tests. Participants \
were divided into SHD and NHD groups based on the normative cutoff of the \
Tinnitus and Hearing Survey-Hearing Subscale (THS-H), and into hearing \
impairment (HI) and NHT based on their audiometric air-conduction thresholds. \
Indi"}, {"     Hearing loss is a major disability in everyday life and \
therapeutic interventions to protect hearing would benefit a large portion of \
the world population. Here we found that mice devoid of the protein kinase \
suppressor of RAS 1 (KSR1) in their tissues (germline KO mice) exhibit \
resistance to both cisplatin- and noise-induced permanent hearing loss \
compared with their wild-type KSR1 littermates. KSR1 is a scaffold protein \
that brings in proximity the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) proteins \
BRAF, MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 and assists in their activation through a \
phosphorylation cascade induced by both cisplatin and noise insults in the \
cochlear cells. KSR1, BRAF, MEK1/2, and ERK1/2 are all ubiquitously expressed \
in the cochlea. Deleting the KSR1 protein tempered down the MAPK \
phosphorylation cascade in the cochlear cells following both cisplatin and \
noise insults and conferred hearing protection of up to 30\[ThickSpace]dB SPL \
in three tested frequencies in male and female mice. Treatment with \
dabrafenib, an FDA-approved oral BRAF inhibitor, protected male and female \
KSR1 wild-type mice from both cisplatin- and noise-induced hearing loss. \
Dabrafenib treatment did not enhance the protection of KO KSR1 mice, \
providing evidence dabrafenib works primarily through the MAPK pathway. Thus, \
either elimination of the KSR1 gene expression or drug inhibition of the MAPK \
cellular pathway in mice resulted in profound protection from both cisplatin- \
and noise-induced hearing loss. Inhibition of the MAPK pathway, a cellular \
pathway that responds to damage in the cochlear cells, can prove a valuable \
strategy to protect and treat hearing loss.     cisplatin hearing loss KSR1 \

is essential for communication, and its loss can cause a serious disruption \
to one\[CloseCurlyQuote]s social life. Hearing loss is also recognized as a \
major risk factor for dementia; therefore, addressing hearing loss is a \
pressing global issue. Sensorineural hearing loss, the predominant type of \
hearing loss, is mainly due to damage to the inner ear along with a variety \
of pathologies including ischemia, noise, trauma, aging, and ototoxic drugs. \
In addition to genetic factors, oxidative stress has been identified as a \
common mechanism underlying several cochlear pathologies. The cochlea, which \
plays a major role in auditory function, requires high-energy metabolism and \
is, therefore, highly susceptible to oxidative stress, particularly in the \
mitochondria. Based on these pathological findings, the potential of \
antioxidants for the treatment of hearing loss has been demonstrated in \
several animal studies. However, results fr"}, "no abstract available", 
 {"no abstract available"}, {"          Hearing loss affects approximately \
18% of the population worldwide. Hearing difficulties in noisy environments \
without accompanying audiometric threshold shifts likely affect an even \
larger percentage of the global population. One of the potential causes of \
hidden hearing loss is cochlear synaptopathy, the loss of synapses between \
inner hair cells (IHC) and auditory nerve fibers (ANF). These synapses are \
the most vulnerable structures in the cochlea to noise exposure or aging. The \
loss of synapses causes auditory deafferentation, i.e., the loss of auditory \
afferent information, whose downstream effect is the loss of information that \
is sent to higher-order auditory processing stages. Understanding the \
physiological and perceptual effects of this early auditory deafferentation \
might inform interventions to prevent later, more severe hearing loss.     In \
the past decade, a large body of work has been devoted to better understand \
hidden hearing loss, including the causes of hidden hearing loss, their \
corresponding impact on the auditory pathway, and the use of auditory \
physiological measures for clinical diagnosis of auditory deafferentation. \
This review synthesizes the findings from studies in humans and animals to \
answer some of the key questions in the field, and it points to gaps in \
knowledge that warrant more investigation. Specifically, recent studies \
suggest that some electrophysiological measures have the potential to \
function as indicators of hidden hearing loss in humans, but more research is \
needed for these measures to be included as part of a clinical test battery.  \

Hearing loss has an extremely high prevalence worldwide and brings incredible \
economic and social burdens. Mechanisms such as epigenetics are profoundly \
involved in the initiation and progression of hearing loss and potentially \
yield definite strategies for hearing loss treatment. Non-coding genes occupy \
97% of the human genome, and their transcripts, non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), are \
widely participated in regulating various physiological and pathological \
situations. NcRNAs, mainly including micro-RNAs (miRNAs), long-stranded \
non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs), are involved in the \
regulation of cell metabolism and cell death by modulating gene expression \
and protein-protein interactions, thus impacting the occurrence and prognosis \
of hearing loss. This review provides a detailed overview of ncRNAs, \
especially miRNAs and lncRNAs, in the pathogenesis of hearing loss. We also \
discuss the shortcomings and issues that need to be addressed in the study of \
hearing loss ncRNAs in the hope of providing viable therapeutic strategies \
for the precise treatment of hearing loss.                 1 Introduction     \

and protein-protein interactions, thus impacting the occurrence and prognosis \
of hearing loss. This review provides a detailed overview of ncRNAs, \
especially miRNAs and lncRNAs, in the pathogenesis of hearing loss. We also \
discuss the shortcomings and issues that need to be addressed in the study of \
hearing loss ncRNAs in the hope of providing viable therapeutic strategies \
for the precise treatment of hearing loss.                 1 Introduction     \
  Based on the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study, deafness is the third \
major cause of disability in the world, which affects more than 5% of the \
population overworld ( Tyrovolas et al., 2022 ). Meanwhile, more people are \
suffering from mild, undiagnosed hearing loss. About 1.57 billion of the \
world population were impacted by hearing loss, a number that could grow to \
2.45 billion by 2050 ( Haile et al., 2021 ). Thus, hearing loss is an \
emerging serious problem. The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies \
hearing loss as mild, moderat"}, {"          Hearing loss is the symptom most \
commonly seen in association with tinnitus. According to the various models \
of tinnitus development, hearing loss also represents the crucial trigger \
mechanism for the development of tinnitus. Since different structures such as \
the outer ear, the middle ear and the inner ear are involved in the \
peripheral hearing process, a distinction is also made between conductive \
hearing loss, sensorineural hearing loss and retrocochlear hearing loss, \
depending on the localization of the pathology. This chapter highlights the \
main causes of conductive hearing loss and sensorineural hearing loss. A \
detailed clarification of the causes of hearing loss in tinnitus is \
important, as in many cases this also leads to specific therapies, which \
ideally will result in an improvement of hearing loss and tinnitus symptoms. \
In the case of middle ear hearing loss, these therapeutic approaches are \
primarily surgical in nature (tympanoplasty, stapes surgery), in the case of \
sensorineural hearing loss, the improvement is generally based on a \
prosthetic fitting with hearing aids or cochlear implants. Graphical Abstract \

  Exposure to loud noise is a common cause of acquired hearing loss. \
Disruption of subcellular calcium homeostasis and downstream stress pathways \
in the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, including the unfolded protein \
response, have been implicated in the pathophysiology of noise-induced \
hearing loss. However, studies on the association between calcium homeostasis \
and stress pathways has been limited due to limited ability to measure \
calcium dynamics in mature-hearing, noise-exposed mice. We used a genetically \
encoded calcium indicator mouse model in which GcAMP is expressed \
specifically in hair cells or supporting cells under control of Myo15Cre or \
Sox2Cre, respectively. We performed live calcium imaging and UPR gene \
expression analysis in 8-week-old mice exposed to levels of noise that cause \
cochlear synaptopathy (98 db SPL) or permanent hearing loss (106 dB SPL). UPR \
activation occurred immediately after noise exposure and was noise \
dose-dependent, with the pro-apoptotic pathway upregulated only after 106 dB \
noise exposure. Spontaneous calcium transients in hair cells and \
intercellular calcium waves in supporting cells, which are present in \
neonatal cochleae, were quiescent in mature-hearing cochleae, but \
re-activated upon noise exposure. 106 dB noise exposure was associated with \
more persistent and expansive ICS wave activity. These findings demonstrate a \
strong and dose-dependent association between noise exposure, UPR activation, \
and changes in calcium homeostasis in hair cells and supporting cells, \
suggesting that targeting these pathways may be effective to develop \
treatments for noise-induced hearing loss. Competing Interest Statement     \

study sought to determine the effect of Occupational Safety and Health \
Administration (OSHA) compliant noise on auditory health and assess whether \
pre-noise near infrared (NIR) light therapy can mitigate the effects of noise \
exposure.       Methods: Over four visits, participants ( n =\[ThinSpace]30, \
NCT#: 03834714) with normal hearing completed baseline hearing health \
assessments followed by exposure to open ear, continuous pink noise at 94 dBA \
for 15\[ThinSpace]min. Immediately thereafter, post-noise hearing tests at \
3000, 4000, and 6000\[ThinSpace]Hz and distortion product otoacoustic \
emissions (DPOAEs) were conducted along with the Modified Rhyme Test (MRT), \
Masking Level Difference Test (MLD), and Fixed Level Frequency Tests (FLFT) \
[collectively referred to as the Central and Peripheral Auditory Test Battery \
(CPATB)] to acquire baseline noise sensitivity profiles. Participants were \
then randomized to either Active or Sham NIR light therapy for \
30\[ThinSpace]min binaurally to conclude Visit 1. Visit 2 (\[GreaterEqual]24 \
and\[ThinSpace]\[LessEqual]\[ThinSpace]48\[ThinSpace]h from Visit 1) began \
with an additional 30-min session of Active NIR light therapy or Sham \
followed by repeat CPATB testing and noise exposure. Post-noise testing was \
again conducted immediately after noise exposure to assess the effect of NIR \
light therapy. The remaining visits were conducted following \[GreaterEqual]"}\

represents a major sensory deficit as it is largely prevalent in the general \
population and can dramatically impair quality of life. One of the most \
prevalent causes of sensorineural hearing loss is noise exposure. \
Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is the second most common form of the \
sensorineural hearing deficit, after age-related hearing loss. Importantly, \
it induces neuropathophysiological alterations in the auditory system, which \
can result in the generation of \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]aberrant auditory \
perceptions\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] such as tinnitus or hyperacusis. Here, we \
review the central plasticity that is triggered by noise-induced hearing \
loss. In brief, there is overwhelming evidence that noise-induced hearing \
loss is associated to compensatory mechanisms in the auditory centers: while \
the sensory inputs are reduced at the periphery (i.e., in the cochlear \
nerve), they are enhanced at virtually all levels of the auditory centers. A \
vast repertoire of molecular mechanisms are involved in these functional \
changes. It is plausible that these peripherally triggered central changes \
can result in tinnitus and/or hyperacusis. Graphical Abstract                 \

 {"           Objectives       Growing epidemiological evidence has shown \
hearing loss is associated with physical inactivity. Currently, there is a \
dearth in evidence investigating why this occurs. This study aimed to \
investigate the barriers and facilitators to physical activity in middle-aged \
and older adults with hearing loss.       Design       Individual \
semi-structured qualitative interviews.       Methods       A \
phenomenological approach was taken. Ten adults \
(\[GreaterEqual]40\[ThinSpace]years) were interviewed via videoconferencing. \
The interview schedule was underpinned by the capability, opportunity, \
motivation and behaviour (COM-B) model. Reflexive thematic analysis was used \
to generate themes, which were subsequently mapped onto the COM-B model and \
behaviour change wheel.       Results       Nine hearing loss specific themes \
were generated, which included the following barriers to physical activity: \
mental fatigue, interaction with the environment (acoustically challenging \
environments, difficulties with hearing aids when physically active) and \
social interactions (perceived stigma). Environmental modifications (digital \
capabilities of hearing aids), social support (hearing loss-only groups) and \
hearing loss self-efficacy were reported to facilitate physical activity.     \
  Conclusions       Middle-aged and older adults with hearing loss experience \
hearing-specific barriers to physical activity, which has a deleterious \
impact on their overall health and well-being. Interventions and public \
health programmes need to be tailored to account for these additional \
barriers. Further research is necessary to test potential behaviour change \
techniques.                                 Statement of Contribution         \
  What is already known on this subject?         Epidemiological research \
suggests adults with hearing loss are less physically active than those \
without. Hearing loss is also associated with greater likelihood of chronic \
health conditions.           What does this study add?         An \
understanding of the hearing-specific barriers to physical activity adults \
with hearing loss face. Identifies potential intervention functions that \
could be used to support physical activity in this population.           \
BACKGROUND       Physical inactivity is a primary risk factor for \
noncommunicable diseases (e.g. diabetes, cardiovascular disease), \
particularly for middle- and older-aged and older adults (World Health \
Organisation [WHO], 2021a ). Globally, ~1.5 billion people experience some \
degree of hearing loss, with the prevalence increasing exponentially from \
middle age (WHO, 2021b ). Epidemiological evidence has demonstrated that \
middle-aged and older adults with hearing loss are less likely to be \
physically active compared to those without hearing loss (Choi et al., 2016 ; \
Gispen et al., 2014 ; Kuo et al., 2021 ; Wells et al., 2020 ). Low levels of \
physical activity in this population are concerning, as older adults with \
hearing loss are also at a greater risk of "}, {"no abstract available"},

prevalence of functional hearing and communication deficits (FHCDs), \
characterized by abnormally low speech recognition and binaural tone \
detection in noise or an abnormally high degree of self-perceived hearing \
difficulties, dramatically increases in active-duty service members (SMs) who \

 {"     Objective     The role of iron chelation in causing hearing loss (HL) \
is still unclear. The present study assessed the prevalence of HL among \
transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT) patients who underwent audiological \
follow-up over a 20-year period.     Methods     We retrospectively analyzed \
clinical records and audiological tests from January 1990 (T0) to December \
2022 (T22) of a group of TDT patients who received iron chelation therapy \
with deferoxamine (DFO), deferiprone (DFP) or deferasirox (DFX), in \
monotherapy or as part of combination therapy.     Results     A total of 42 \
adult TDT patients (18 male, 24 female; age range: 41\[Dash]55 years; mean \
age: 49.2\[NonBreakingSpace]\[PlusMinus]\[NonBreakingSpace]3.7 years) were \
included in the study. At the T22 assessment, the overall prevalence of \
sensorineural HL was 23.8\[NonBreakingSpace]% (10/42). When patients were \
stratified into two groups, with and without ototoxicity, no differences were \
observed for sex, age, BMI, creatinine level, pre-transfusional hemoglobin, \
start of transfusions, cardiac or hepatic T2 MRI; only ferritin serum values \
and duration of chelation were significantly higher ( p \
=\[NonBreakingSpace]0.02 and p =\[NonBreakingSpace]0.01, respectively) in \
patients with hearing impairment in comparison to those with normal hearing.  \
   Conclusion     This study \
with\[NonBreakingSpace]long-term\[NonBreakingSpace]follow-up suggests that \
iron chelation therapy might induce ototoxicity; therefore, a long and \
accurate audiological follow-up should be performed in TDT patients.     \

Subjective tinnitus is heard by the patient only, whereas objective tinnitus \

subjective tinnitus. Tinnitus often is associated with hearing loss, but \
there are great many other causes that range from medications to vascular \
abnormalities to tumors. Tinnitus should be characterized, and potentially \
serious treatable causes should be identified whenever possible.          \

for cancer treatment. Permanent hearing loss is one of the most serious side \
effects of cisplatin, but there are few FDA-approved medicines to prevent it. \
We applied high-through screening and target fishing and identified aldose \
reductase, a key enzyme of the polyol pathway, as a novel target for treating \
cisplatin ototoxicity. Cisplatin treatment significantly increased the \
expression level and enzyme activity of aldose reductase in the cochlear \
sensory epithelium. Genetic knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of aldose \
reductase showed a significant protective effect on cochlear hair cells. \
Cisplatin-induced overactivation of aldose reductase led to the decrease of \
NADPH/NADP+ and GSH/GSSG ratios, as well as the increase of oxidative stress, \
and contributed to hair cell death. Results of target prediction, molecular \
docking, and enzyme activity detection further identified that Tiliroside was \
an effective inhibitor of aldose reductase. Tiliroside was proven to inhibit \
the enzymatic activity of aldose reductase via competitively interfering with \
the substrate-binding region. Both Tiliroside and another clinically approved \
aldose reductase inhibitor, Epalrestat, inhibited cisplatin-induced oxidative \
stress and subsequent cell death and thus protected hearing function. These \
findings discovered the role of aldose reductase in the pathogenesis of \
cisplatin-induced deafness and identified aldose reductase as a new target \
for the prevention and treatment of hearing loss.     Graphical abstract      \

"}, {"             Objectives       Type 1 diabetes (T1D) has been associated \
with several comorbidities such as ocular, renal, and cardiovascular \
complications. However, the effect of T1D on the auditory system and \
sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is still not clear. The aim of this study \
was to conduct a systematic review to evaluate whether T1D is associated with \
hearing impairment.           Methods       The databases PubMed, Science \
Direct, Scopus, and EMBASE were searched in accordance with the Preferred \
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) criteria. \
Three reviewers independently screened, selected, and extracted data. The \
Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Tools for Analytical \
cross-sectional and case-control studies were used to perform quality \
assessment and risk of bias analysis on eligible studies.           Results   \
    After screening a total of 463 studies, 11 eligible original articles \
were included in the review to analyze the effects of T1D on the auditory \
system. The included studies comprised cross-sectional and case-control \
investigations. A total of 5,792 patients were evaluated across the 11 \
articles included. The majority of the studies showed that T1D was associated \
with hearing impairment compared to controls, including differences in PTAs \
and OAEs, increased mean hearing thresholds, altered acoustic reflex \
thresholds, and problems with the medial olivocochlear (MOC) reflex \
inhibitory effect. Significant risk factors included older age, increased \
disease duration, and higher HbA1C levels.           Conclusions       This \
systematic review suggests that there is a correlation between T1D and \
impairment on the auditory system. A multidisciplinary collaboration between \
endocrinologists, otolaryngologists, and audiologists will lead to early \
detection of hearing impairment in people with T1D resulting in early \
intervention and better clinical outcomes in pursuit of improving the quality \
of life of affected individuals.           Registration       This systematic \

Cochlear implants (CI) have revolutionized the treatment of patients with \
severe to profound sensory hearing loss by providing a method of bypassing \
normal hearing to directly stimulate the auditory nerve. A further advance in \
the field has been the introduction of \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]hearing \
preservation\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] surgery, whereby the CI electrode array \
(EA) is carefully inserted to spare damage to the delicate anatomy and \
function of the cochlea. Preserving residual function of the inner ear allows \
patients to receive maximal benefit from the CI and to combine CI electric \
stimulation with acoustic hearing, offering improved postoperative speech, \
hearing, and quality of life outcomes. However, under the current paradigm of \
implant surgery, where EAs are inserted by hand, the cochlea cannot be \
reliably spared from damage. Robotics-assisted EA insertion is an emerging \
technology that may overcome fundamental human kinetic limitations that \
prevent consistency in achieving steady and slow EA insertion. This review \
begins by describing the relationship between EA insertion speed and \
generation of intracochlear forces and pressures. The various mechanisms by \
which these intracochlear forces can damage the cochlea and lead to worsened \
postoperative outcomes are discussed. The constraints of manual insertion \
technique are compared to robotics-assisted methods, followed by an overview \
of the current and future state of robotics-assisted EA insertion.            \
Introduction       Cochlear implants (CI) have quickly become the predominant \
intervention for treating patients with severe to profound sensory hearing \
loss. Historically, CIs were used mostly in patients who had minimal to no \
remaining acoustic hearing, as it was thought "}, "no abstract available",

[Opens in a new window]          Abstract           Objectives     This study \
aimed to evaluate the sensory processing abilities of adults with acquired \
hearing loss and determine whether their sensory processing patterns differ \
from those of the general population and adults with normal hearing.     \
Method     The study evaluated the sensory processing functions of 30 adults \
with acquired hearing loss using the Adolescent/Adult Sensory Profile and \
compared them with the sensory processing functions of 30 adults with normal \
hearing.     Results     The results showed that individuals with hearing \
loss have a significantly higher sensitivity to stimuli related to motion, \
vision, activity and touch, exhibiting a low-registration sensory pattern and \
a sensation-avoiding pattern that differed from those of most individuals.    \
 Conclusion     Assessing sensory processing profiles can help identify \
specific sensory difficulties and inform individualised treatment plans. The \
study highlights the importance of considering sensory processing patterns in \
the management of hearing loss to improve overall well-being and quality of \
life for adults with hearing loss.                "},

weight central obesity (NWCO) in the prognosis of sudden sensorineural \
hearing loss (SSNHL). Methods:     We retrospectively investigated 807 cases \
of SSNHL from January of 2008 to August of 2019 from the Department of \
Otorhinolaryngology at Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital in southern \
Taiwan. We analyzed the association between overweight and obesity, NWCO, and \
the prognosis of SSNHL. The demographic and clinical characteristics, \
audiometry results, and outcomes were also reviewed. Results:     The \
nonobese (body mass index [BMI]\[ThinSpace]<\[ThinSpace]24\[ThinSpace]kg/m 2 \
) and overweight and obese groups \
(BMI\[ThinSpace]\[GreaterEqual]\[ThinSpace]24\[ThinSpace]kg/m 2 ) comprised \
343 (42.50%) and 464 (57.50%) patients, respectively. The favorable prognosis \
rates in the nonobese and the overweight and obese groups were 45.48% and \
45.91%, respectively, without a significant difference ( P \
=\[ThinSpace].9048). Multivariate logistic regression revealed that BMI \
(adjusted odds ratio [aOR]\[ThinSpace]=\[ThinSpace]1.00, 95% \
CI\[ThinSpace]=\[ThinSpace]0.948-1.062, P =\[ThinSpace].9165) was not \
significantly associated with SSNHL recovery. The normal weight noncentral \
obesity (NWNCO) and NWCO groups comprised 266 (77.55%) and 77 (22.45%) \
patients, respectively, and had favorable prognosis rates of 48.50% and \
35.06%, respectively. The difference between the groups was significant ( P \
=\[ThinSpace].0371). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that \
NWCO (aOR\[ThinSpace]=\[ThinSpace]2.51, 95% \
CI\[ThinSpace]=\[ThinSpace]1.292-5.019, P =\[ThinSpace].0075) was \
significantly associated with SSNHL recovery. Conclusions:     NWCO may \

Prevalence of hearing loss in college students: a meta-analysis               \

Ikuta     Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders, University of \
Mississippi, Oxford, MS, United States       Introduction: Hearing loss among \
college students, specifically noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL), appears to \
be increasing. This may be particularly challenging for this population as \
college students are required to listen to lectures in classrooms that may \
have suboptimal listening environments. College-aged musicians are at a \
particularly high risk due to repeated and extended exposure to loud noise. \
Therefore, the purpose of the current study was (1) to examine the prevalence \
of hearing loss in college students and (2) to emphasize the importance of \
detecting hearing loss at 6,000\[ThinSpace]Hz.       Methods: A meta-analysis \
was conducted using the PRISMA model. The literature search yielded 8 studies \
(1,950 subjects) that tested hearing loss using an audiogram and Distortion \
Product Otoacoustic Emissions (DPOAEs). All studies used audiologic tests to \
detect hearing loss among college students between the ages of \
17\[Dash]35\[ThinSpace]years.       Results: Results indicate that the \
prevalence of hearing loss in college students is 19%. In addition, the \
prevalence of hearing loss at 6,000\[ThinSpace]Hz is 85% among student \
musicians. For this meta-analysis, slight sensorineural hearing loss, or \
thresholds greater than 20\[ThinSpace]dB bilaterally or unilaterally, \
qualified as hearing loss.       Discussion: Decreased hearing at \
6,000\[ThinSpace]Hz may lead to an individual\[CloseCurlyQuote]s inability to \
hear important environmental factors and high frequency speech sounds. \
College students without full auditory function at this frequency may have \
difficulties performing in class based on decreased attention, comprehension, \
and memory. Although students may not realize the influence of their \
6,000\[ThinSpace]Hz hearing loss or be unaware of its presence, it could \
significantly change their likelihood to succeed in college. Therefore, \
implementing a hearing conservation program may be advised for colleges and \
universities to help prevent hearing loss in students, particularly for \
collegiate musicians. In addition, it may be beneficial to screen hearing in \
colleg"}, {"no abstract available"}, {"             Nanoparticle-based drug \
delivery strategies have emerged as a crucial avenue for comprehensive \
sensorineural hearing loss treatment. Nevertheless, developing therapy \
vectors crossing both biological and cellular barriers has encountered \
significant challenges deriving from various external factors. Herein, the \
rational integration of gelatin nanoparticles (GNPs) with tetrahedral DNA \
nanostructures (TDNs) to engineer a distinct drug-delivery nanosystem \
(designed as TDN@GNP) efficiently enhances the biological permeability and \
cellular internalization, further resolving the dilemma of noise-induced \
hearing loss via loading epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) with anti-lipid \
peroxidation property. Rationally engineering of TDN@GNP demonstrates \
dramatic alterations in the physicochemical key parameters of TDNs that are \
pivotal in cell-particle interactions and promote cellular uptake through \
multiple endocytic pathways. Furthermore, the EGCG-loaded nanosystem \
(TDN-EGCG@GNP) facilitates efficient inner ear drug delivery by superior \
permeability through the biological barrier (round window membrane), \
maintaining high drug concentration within the inner ear. The TDN-EGCG@GNP \
actively overcomes the cell membrane, exhibiting hearing protection from \
noise insults via reduced lipid peroxidation in outer hair cells and spiral \
ganglion neurons. This work exemplifies how integrating diverse vector \
functionalities can overcome biological and cellular barriers in the inner \
ear, offering promising applications for inner ear disorders.                 \
  1 "}, {"     Objective     Hearing disorders are common among music \
professionals, as they are frequently exposed to sound levels exceeding \
100\[ThinSpace]dB(A). By assessing auditory fatigue, situations that are \
deleterious for hearing could be identified, allowing the deployment of \
preventive measures before permanent impairment occurs. However, little is \
known about the factors contributing to auditory fatigue. The objective is to \
determine the exposure parameters most influencing auditory fatigue during \
occupational exposure to amplified music.     Design     Auditory fatigue was \
defined as variations of both pure tone auditory (\[CapitalDelta]PTA) and \
efferent reflex thresholds (\[CapitalDelta]ER) during the workday. Noise \
exposure was monitored and information on the volunteers was gathered using a \
questionnaire.     Study sample     The population consisted of 43 adult \
volunteers exposed to amplified music (sound, light or stage technicians, \
security agents, barmen) and 24 unexposed administrative agents.     Results  \
   \[CapitalDelta]PTA and \[CapitalDelta]ER were positively correlated with \
the energy of noise exposure and its stability over time, i.e a steady noise \
tends to create more auditory fatigue.     Conclusion     In addition to a \
global decrease of music levels and a systematic use of hearing protection, \
our results advocate for the provision of quiet periods within noise \
exposures as they reduce auditory fatigue accumulation and long-term risks \
for hearing.          "}, {" Book Review Brief Communication Brief Report \

Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is a prevalent form of adult hearing \
impairment, characterized by oxidative damage to auditory sensory hair cells. \
Although certain dihydropyridines, the L-type calcium channel blockers, \
exhibit protective properties against such damage, the ability of \
third-generation dihydropryidines like lercanidipine to mitigate NIHL remains \
unclear.We utilized glucose oxidase (GO)-treated OC1 cell lines and cochlear \
explants to evaluate the protective influence of lercanidipine on hair cells. \
To further investigate its effectiveness, we exposed noise-stimulated mice in \
vivo and analyzed their hearing thresholds. Additionally, we assessed the \
antioxidative capabilities of lercanidipine by examining oxidation-related \
enzyme expression and levels of oxidative stress markers, including \
3-nitrotyrosine (3NT) and 4-hydroxynonenal (4HNE). Our findings demonstrate \
that lercanidipine significantly reduce"}, {"     Background     The stria \
vascularis (SV), located in the lateral wall of the cochlea, maintains \
cochlear fluid homeostasis and mechanoelectrical transduction (MET) activity \
required for sound wave conduction. The pathogenesis of a number of human \
inheritable deafness syndromes, age related hearing loss, drug-induced \
ototoxicity and noise-induced hearing loss results from the morphological \
changes and functional impairments in the development of the SV. In this \
study, we investigate the implications of intercellular communication within \
the SV in the pathogenesis of sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). We aim to \
identify commonly regulated signaling pathways using publicly available \
single-cell transcriptomic sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets. Methods     We \
analyzed scRNA-seq data, which was derived from studying the cochlear SV in \
mice with SNHL compared to normal adult mice. After quality control and \
filtering, we obtained the major cellular components of the mouse cochlear SV \
and integrated the data. Using Seurat's FindAllMarkers and FindMarkers \
packages, we searched for novel conservative genes and differential genes. We \
employed KEGG and GSEA to identify molecular pathways that are commonly \
altered among different types of SNHL. We utilized pySCENIC to discover new \
specific regulatory factors in SV subpopulation cells. With the help of \
CellChat, we identified changes in subpopulation cells showing similar trends \
across different SNHL types and their alterations in intercellular \
communication pathways. Results     Through the analysis of the integrated \
data, we discovered new conserved genes to SV specific cells and identified \
common downregulated pathways in three types of SNHL. The enriched genes for \
these pathways showing similar trends are primarily associated with the \
Electron Transport Chain, related to mitochondrial energy metabolism. Using \
the CellChat package, we further found that there are shared pathways in the \
incoming signaling of specific intermediate cells in SNHL, and these pathways \
have common upstream regulatory transcription factor of Nfe2l2. Combining the \
results from pySCENIC and CellChat, we predicted the transcription factor \
Nfe2l2 as an upstream regulatory factor for multiple shared cellular pathways \
in IC. Additionally, it serves as an upstream factor for several genes within \
the Electron Transport Chain. Conclusion     Our bioinformatics analysis has \
revealed that downregulation of the mitochondrial electron transport chain \
have been observed in various conditions of SNHL. E2f1, Esrrb, Runx1, Yy1, \
and Gata2 could serve as novel important common TFs regulating the electron \
transport chain. Adm has emerged as a potential new marker gene for \
intermediate cells, while Itgb5 and Tesc show promise as potential new marker \
genes for marginal cells in the SV. These findings offer a new perspective on \
SV lesions in SNHL and provide additional theoretical evidence for the same \
drug treatment and prevention of different pathol"},

with some form of hearing loss and have difficulty understanding speech in \
the presence of background sound. Experiences resulting from such \
difficulties include increased listening effort and fatigue. Social \
interactions may become less appealing in the context of such experiences, \
and age-related hearing loss is associated with an increased risk of social \
isolation and associated negative psychosocial health outcomes. However, the \
precise relationship between age-related hearing loss and social isolation is \
not well described. Here, we review the literature and synthesize existing \
work from different domains to propose a framework with three conceptual \
anchor stages to describe the relation between hearing loss and social \
isolation: within-situation disengagement from listening, social withdrawal, \
and social isolation. We describe the distinct characteristics of each stage \
and suggest potential interventions to mitigate negative impacts of hearing \
loss on social lives and health. We close by outlining potential implications \
for researchers and clinicians.     Introduction     The World Health \
Organization's World Report on Hearing (2021) indicates that over 65% of \
adults aged 60 years or above experience some form of hearing loss ( \
Cruickshanks et al., 1998 ; Feder et al., 2015 ; Helfer et al., 2017 ), such \
as speech understanding difficulties when background sound is present ( Pang \
et al., 2019 ; Schneider et al., 2000 ). Speech masked by background sound \
requires a listener to invest cognitively to understand what is said ( Hicks \
& Tharpe, 2002 ; Van Engen et al., 2012 ), and this cognitive load appears to \
be particularly high for older adults with hearing loss ( Pichora-Fuller et \
al., 2016 ; R\[ODoubleDot]nnberg et al., 2013 ). Common aversive experiences \
that result from such comprehension difficulties and cognitive investment \
include feelings of listening effort, fatigue, and frustration ( Francis & \
Oliver, 2018 ; Herrmann & Johnsrude, 2020 ; Hornsby et al., 2016 ; McGarrigle \
et al., 2014 ; Pichora-Fuller et al., 2016 ) that make social interactions \
less appealing and can lead to avoidance behaviors ( Pang et al., 2019 ). It \
is thus not surprising that hearing loss has been associated with fewer \
social connections and an increased likelihood of social isolation ( Bott & \
Saunders, 2021 ; Shukla et al., 2020 ).     Social isolation refer"},

Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) often accompanies cochlear synaptopathy, \
which can be potentially reversed to restore hearing. However, there has been \
little success in achieving complete recovery of sensorineural deafness using \
nearly noninvasive middle ear drug delivery before. Here, we present a study \
demonstrating the efficacy of a middle ear delivery system employing \
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)\[Dash]poly-( dl -lactic acid- co \
-glycolic acid) (PLGA)-loaded hydrogel in reversing synaptopathy and \
restoring hearing function in a mouse model with NIHL. The mouse model \
achieved using the single noise exposure (NE, 115 dBL, 4 h) exhibited an \
average 20 dBL elevation of hearing thresholds with intact cochlear hair \
cells but a loss of ribbon synapses as the primary cause of hearing \
impairment. We developed a BDNF-PLGA-loaded thermosensitive hydrogel, which \
was administered via a single controllable injection into the tympanic cavity \
of noise-exposed mice, allowing its presence in the middle ear for a duration \
of 2 weeks. This intervention resulted in complete restoration of NIHL at \
frequencies of click, 4, 8, 16, and 32 kHz. Moreover, the cochlear ribbon \
synapses exhibited significant recovery, whereas other cochlear components \
(hair cells and auditory nerves) remained unchanged. Additionally, the \
cochlea of NE treated mice revealed activation of tropomyosin receptor kinase \
B (TRKB) signaling upon exposure to BDNF. These findings demonstrate a \
controllable and minimally invasive therapeutic approach that utilizes a \
BDNF-PLGA-loaded hydrogel to restore NIHL by specifically repairing cochlear \
synaptopathy. This tailored middle ear delivery system holds great promise \
for achieving ideal clinical outcomes in the treatment of NIHL and cochlear \
synaptopathy. ACS Publications     Copyright \[Copyright] 2024 American \

behaviour and hearing aid use in Samutprakarn, Thailand.       Method: Three \
focus groups ( n =25), with adults aged 60-88 years, were conducted within a \
residential complex for older adults. Qualitative data analysis, employing a \
phenomenological approach was completed.       Results: Four themes are \
presented: (1) Perception of hearing difficulties, (2) Experience of \
receiving care, (3) Attitudes towards wearing hearing aids, and (4) Raising \
awareness of hearing difficulties in older adults. Findings indicate that \
Thai older adults may not be aware or accepting of their hearing \
difficulties, due to the stigma associated hearing loss, older age, and \
disability. The consequential impact of these unacknowledged issues manifest \
in communication challenges and the adoption of avoidance behaviours across \
diverse situational contexts.       Conclusion: This study enhances our \
understanding of how Thai older adults perceive hearing problems and ear \
care. Findings underscore the potential pivotal role of familial and social \
networks in mitigating barriers associated with hearing difficulties among \
older adults in Thailand. These insights can raise awareness and inform \
effective management for older adults and their families. Additionally, the \
findings could guide healthcare providers, resear"},

a prevalent hearing-loss deficit manifested as a phantom (internally \
generated by the brain) sound that is heard as a high-frequency tone in the \
majority of afflicted persons. Chronic tinnitus is debilitating, leading to \
distress, sleep deprivation, anxiety, and even suicidal thoughts. It has been \
theorized that, in the majority of afflicted persons, tinnitus can be \
attributed to the loss of high-frequency input from the cochlea to the \
auditory cortex, known as deafferentation. Deafferentation due to hearing \
loss develops with aging, which progressively causes tonotopic regions coding \
for the lost high-frequency coding to synchronize, leading to a phantom \
high-frequency sound sensation. Approaches to tinnitus remediation that \
demonstrated promise include inhibitory drugs, the use of tinnitus-specific \
frequency notching to increase lateral inhibition to the deafferented \
neurons, and multisensory approaches"}, {"          Sudden sensorineural \
hearing loss (SSNHL) constitutes an urgent otologic emergency, marked by a \
rapid decline of at least 30\[NonBreakingSpace]dB across three consecutive \
frequencies within 72\[NonBreakingSpace]h. While previous studies have noted \
brain region alterations encompassing both auditory and non-auditory areas, \
this research examines functional connectivity changes across integrity, \
network, and edge levels in SSNHL. The cohort included 184 participants: 107 \
SSNHL patients and 77 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Our \
investigation comprises: (1) characterization of overall functional \
connectivity degree across 55 nodes in nine networks \
(p\[NonBreakingSpace]<\[NonBreakingSpace]0.05, corrected for false discovery \
rate), exposing integrity level changes; (2) identification of reduced \
intranetwork connectivity strength within sensory and attention networks \
(somatomotor network, auditory network, ventral attention network, dorsal \
attention network) in SSNHL individuals \
(p\[NonBreakingSpace]<\[NonBreakingSpace]0.05, Bonferroni corrected), and \
reduced internetwork connectivity across twelve distinct subnetwork pairs \
(p\[NonBreakingSpace]<\[NonBreakingSpace]0.05, FDR corrected); (3) revelation \
of increased internetwork connectivity in SSNHL patients, primarily spanning \
dorsal attention network, fronto parietal network, default mode network, and \
limbic network, alongside widespread reductions in connectivity patterns \
among the nine distinct resting-state brain networks. The study further \
uncovers negative correlations between SSNHL duration and intranetwork \
connectivity of the auditory network \

        "}, {"       Percussionists are at risk for noise-induced hearing \
loss. They are especially at risk because of the type of sound produced by \
their instrument \[Dash] impact noise. The quick onset and offset times \
combined with the high peak intensity levels can create permanent damage to \
the auditory system. Damage to the auditory system because of excessive \
exposure to music is called a music-induced hearing disorder (MIHD).       A \
MIHD may manifest as many different permanent disorders including \
music-induced hearing loss, tinnitus, decreased sound tolerance, diplacusis, \
or dysacusis. Symptoms of these disorders may affect the musicians in their \
art and their jobs as many musicians rely on their perception of sound and \
music to play their instruments. Sound exposure can be damaging depending on \
two factors \[Dash] the intensity level that the musician is exposed to and \
the duration of the exposure. Reducing the intensity level of the sound and \
the duration of the exposure can help protect the musician from permanent \
auditory damage. Many products on the market offer a safer listening and \
playing experience for musicians including percussion-specific equipment.     \
  If auditory damage has already occurred, the musician should visit an \
audiologist who can provide them with care for their MIHD and education about \
safe sound exposure limits. Best practice guidelines for the audiologist are \
outlined in Chapter II of the document and include thorough education and \
verified care and services. Music-induced hearing disorders are preventable. \
It is the duty of the audiologist to spread awareness and education to \
percussionists and all musicians for the prevention of MIHD.                 \

 {"     Purpose     Yakshagana is a type of folk-art theatre portraying \
mythological and historical stories. It includes artists who play \
predominantly percussion instruments besides cymbals and harmonium. \
Professional musicians exposing themselves to deafening sounds are prone to \
develop noise-induced complications. [1] One such professional in the coastal \
districts of Karnataka state is a Yakshagana himmela (backstage) artist. \
There is no reported literature concerning these artists' hearing health and \
problems. Hence, the proposed study was aimed at developing, validating and \
assessing the Knowledge, Attitude and Practice (KAP )of Yakshagana Mela \
artists towards Music-Induced Hearing Loss (MIHL), a possible risk factor of \
their profession. Method     This study was carried out on 139 yakshagana \
mela artists with a mean age of 41.63 years. It was conducted in two phases. \
In the first phase, an expert committee discussion was conducted to verify, \
modify and validate the questionnaire. The second phase included the \
administration of the developed questionnaire on the artists. Results     The \
sum scores for each domain of KAP were computed. Scores above 80% were \
defined as good knowledge, practice, and a positive attitude. The findings of \
the study revealed that more than half of the participants demonstrated \
inadequate knowledge (63.3%) and negative attitude (63.7%), but a fair level \
of practice (65.4%). Conclusion     From the outcome of the present study, it \
can be inferred that in spite of being in a profession with a high risk of \
MIHL, the participants considered hearing health as their least priority. The \
study illustrates the need for initiating hearing and conservation programs \
to improve awareness & combat music induced hearing loss in this population.  \

multivariate logistic regression analysis. The nomogram was constructed based \
on the results of multivariate logistic regression analysis, and the model \
was verified by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, calibration \

Objective     Balance difficulties are common in children with sensorineural \
hearing loss (SNHL). For some of these children, concomitant vestibular \
deficits may impact postural control. This study aimed to explore vestibular \
function, functional balance and postural control, and the relationship \
between these measures in children with SNHL.     Design     Cross-sectional \
study quantifying peripheral vestibular function (vestibular evoked myogenic \
potentials [VEMP], video head impulse test), functional balance \
(Bruininks\[Dash]Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency [BOT]) and postural \
control (static posturography with modified sensory inputs). The relationship \
between the degree of vestibular impairment, functional balance and postural \
control was explored.     Study sample     Eleven with SNHL, and 11 with \
normal sound detection (NSD) between 5 and 12\[ThinSpace]years of age.     \
Results     Children with SNHL had varying degrees of vestibular dysfunction \
and differences in overall balance performance. Across all children, greater \
degrees of vestibular impairment were associated with significantly poorer \
functional balance and postural control performance for complex standing \
conditions (BOT percentile rank p =\[ThinSpace]0.001; compliant surface eyes \
open [EO]: p =\[ThinSpace]0.027; compliant surface eyes closed: p \
=\[ThinSpace]0.048).     Conclusions     Vestibular dysfunction in children \
with SNHL was variable. Vestibular impairment predicted poorer functional \
balance performance and postural control abilities, including differences in \
postural sway patterns.          "}, {" Book Review Brief Communication Brief \

Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is a major cause of hearing impairment and \
is linked to dementia and mental health conditions, yet no FDA-approved drugs \
exist to prevent it. Downregulating the mitogen-activated protein kinase \
(MAPK) cellular pathway has emerged as a promising approach to attenuate \
NIHL, but the molecular targets and the mechanism of protection are not fully \
understood. Here, we tested specifically the role of the kinases ERK1/2 in \
noise otoprotection using a newly developed, highly specific ERK1/2 \
inhibitor, tizaterkib, in preclinical animal models. Tizaterkib is currently \
being tested in phase 1 clinical trials for cancer treatment and has high \
oral bioavailability and low predicted systemic toxicity in mice and humans. \
In this study, we performed dose\[Dash]response measurements of \
tizaterkib\[CloseCurlyQuote]s efficacy against permanent NIHL in adult FVB/NJ \
mice, and its minimum effective dose (0.5 mg/kg/bw), therapeu"}, 
 {"           Objectives       To assess outcomes associated with \
photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) for hearing loss in human and animal \
studies.       Design       Systematic review and narrative synthesis in \
accordance with PRISMA guidelines.       Setting       Data bases searched: \
MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, ClinicalTrials.gov and Web of Science. No limits \
were placed on language or year of publication. Review conducted in \
accordance with the PRISMA 2020 statement.       Participants       All human \
and animal subjects treated with PBMT for hearing loss.       Main outcome \
measures       Pre- and post-PBMT audio metric outcomes.       Results       \
Searches identified 122 abstracts and 49 full text articles. Of these, 17 \
studies met the inclusion criteria, reporting outcomes in 327 animals (11 \
studies), 30 humans (1 study), and 40 animal specimens (5 studies). PBMT \
parameters included 6 different wavelengths: 908 nm (1 study), 810 nm (1 \
study), 532 & 635 nm (1 study), 830 nm (3 studies), 808 nm (11 studies). The \
duration ranged from 4 to 60 minutes in a session, and the follow-up ranged \
from 5\[Dash]28\[ThinSpace]days. Outcomes improved significantly when \
wavelengths within the range of 800\[Dash]830 nm were used, and with greater \
duration of PBMT exposure. Included studies predominantly consisted of \
non-randomized controlled trials (10 studies).       Conclusions       \
Hearing outcomes following PBMT appear to be superior to no PBMT for subjects \
with hearing loss, although higher level evidence is required to verify this. \
PBMT enables concentrated, focused delivery of light therapy to the inner ear \
through a non-invasive manner with minimal side effects. As a result of \
heterogeneity in reporting PBMT parameters and outcomes across the included \
studies, direct comparison is challenging.                                 \
Key points             Photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) is a potential \
non-invasive treatment option for hearing loss with minimal adverse effects. \
To date, only one human trial has assessed the use of PBMT in the treatment \
of hearing loss. This study showed no statistically significant improvement \
in hearing outcomes. Animal studies utilising longer wavelength PBMT for \
longer duration of therapy demonstrated improvements in audiological \
outcomes. Further human trials are required to determine the efficacy and \
safety of PBMT to treat hearing loss.           1 "},

Shiramatsu  Hirokazu Takahashi *     Department of Mechano-Informatics, \
Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, The University of \
Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan       Introduction: Both tinnitus and hyperacusis, likely \
triggered by hearing loss, can be attributed to maladaptive plasticity in \
auditory perception. However, owing to their co-occurrence, disentangling \
their neural mechanisms proves difficult. We hypothesized that the neural \
correlates of tinnitus are associated with neural activities triggered by \
low-intensity tones, while hyperacusis is linked to responses to moderate- \
and high-intensity tones.       Methods: To test these hypotheses, we \
conducted behavioral and electrophysiological experiments in rats 2 to \
8\[ThinSpace]days after traumatic tone exposure.       Results: In the \
behavioral experiments, prepulse and gap inhibition tended to exhibit \
different frequency characteristics (although not reaching sufficient \
statistical levels), suggesting that exposure to traumatic tones led to acute \
symptoms of hyperacusis and tinnitus at different frequency ranges. When \
examining the auditory cortex at the thalamocortical recipient layer, we \
observed that tinnitus symptoms correlated with a disorganized tonotopic map, \
typically characterized by responses to low-intensity tones. Neural \
correlates of hyperacusis were found in the cortical recruitment function at \
the multi-unit activity (MUA) level, but not at the local field potential \
(LFP) level, in response to moderate- and high-intensity tones. This shift \
from LFP to MUA was associated with a loss of monotonicity, suggesting a \
crucial role for inhibitory synapses.       Discussion: Thus, in acute \
symptoms of traumatic tone exposure, our experiments successfully \
disentangled the neural correlates of tinnitus and hyperacusis at the \
thalamocortical recipient layer of the auditory cortex. They also suggested \
that tinnitus is linked to central noise, whereas hyperacusis is associated \
with aberrant gain control. Further interactions between animal experiments \
and clinical studies "}, {"no abstract available"},

    Background: Early sensory experiences have a significant impact on the \
later life of preterm infants. The NICU soundscape is profoundly influenced \
by various modalities of respiratory support or ventilation, which are often \
mandatory early in the care. The incubator, believed to shield from external \
noise, is less effective against noise originating inside. The objective of \
this study was to evaluate the sound levels and characteristics of frequently \
used respiratory support and ventilation modalities, taking into \
consideration the developing auditory system of premature infants.       \
Methods: To evaluate sound dynamics inside and outside an incubator during \
respiratory support/ventilation, experimental recordings were conducted at \
the Center for Pediatric Simulation Training of the Medical University \
Vienna. The ventilator used was a FABIAN HFOI\[RegisteredTrademark].       \
Results: Jet CPAP (Continuous positive airway pressure), whether administered \
via mask or prongs, generates significantly higher sound levels compared to \
High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) and to High-frequency oscillatory ventilation \
(HFOV) delivered through an endotracheal tube. Upon evaluating the sound \
spectrum of jet CPAP support, a spectral peak is observed within the \
frequency range of 4 to 8 kHz. Notably, this frequency band aligns with the \
range where the hearing threshold of preterm infants is at its most \
sensitive.       Conclusion: Non-invasive HFNC and invasive HFOV generate \
lower soun"}, {"          Tinnitus is a prevalent hearing-loss deficit \
manifested as a phantom (internally generated by the brain) sound that is \
heard as a high-frequency tone in the majority of afflicted persons. Chronic \
tinnitus is debilitating, leading to distress, sleep deprivation, anxiety, \
and even suicidal thoughts. It has been theorized that, in the majority of \
afflicted persons, tinnitus can be attributed to the loss of high-frequency \
input from the cochlea to the auditory cortex, known as deafferentation. \
Deafferentation due to hearing loss develops with aging, which progressively \
causes tonotopic regions coding for the lost high-frequency coding to \
synchronize, leading to a phantom high-frequency sound sensation. Approaches \
to tinnitus remediation that demonstrated promise include inhibitory drugs, \
the use of tinnitus-specific frequency notching to increase lateral \
inhibition to the deafferented neurons, and multisensory approaches \
(auditory-motor and audiovisual) that work by coupling multisensory \
stimulation to the deafferented neural populations. The goal of this review \
is to put forward a theoretical framework of a multisensory approach to \
remedy tinnitus. Our theoretical framework posits that due to visions \
modulatory (inhibitory, excitatory) influence on the auditory pathway, a \
prolonged engagement in audiovisual activity, especially during daily \
discourse, as opposed to auditory-only activity/discourse, can progressively \
reorganize deafferented neural populations, resulting in the reduced \
synchrony of the deafferented neurons and a reduction in tinnitus severity \
over time.     Many UC-authored scholarly publications are freely available \

Metrics and citations Figures and tables          Abstract     Objectives: \
Age-related hearing loss (ARHL) is a complex disease associated with the \
interaction of multiple factors. Furthermore, indicators of liver function \
represent the body\[CloseCurlyQuote]s metabolic, immune, and repair \
abilities. This study investigated correlations between liver function and \
ARHL. Methods: A total of 107 patients with ARHL and 107 age- and sex-matched \
healthy volunteers were included. Linear correlations, logistic regression, \
and receiving operator characteristic curves were used to assess the \
associations between liver function and ARHL. Results: Serum prealbumin (PAB) \
levels were significantly lower in the ARHL group compared to the control \
group. Logistic regression analysis indicated that low PAB levels may be an \
independent risk factor for ARHL. The ARHL was divided into 2 groups \
according to the degree of hearing loss (moderately severe-to-profound and \
mild-to-moderate); the median ages in the 2 groups were 70.48 and 66.85 \
years, respectively, with the difference being significant. Age was an \
independent risk factor for moderately severe-to-profound ARHL, as shown by \
the logistic regression analysis. Conclusions: Lower PAB levels in patients \
with ARHL suggested that PAB may be a risk factor for ARHL. Furthermore, \
higher age in patients with ARHL was associated with a greater degree of \
hearing loss.     Introduction     According to the \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]World Report on Hearing\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
published by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2021, hearing impairment \
affects more than 1.5 billion people globally, and predictions show that \
around 2.5 billion people will have experienced some degree of hearing loss \
by 2025. 1 The most common cause of hearing loss in older adults worldwide is \
presbycusis, or age-related hearing loss (ARHL). 2 The WHO estimates that \
approximately 164.5 million people aged >65 years worldwide had hearing \
impairment in 2012. 3 With the current increasing age of the global \
population and increasing life expectancy, more than 500 million people over \
the age of 60 are expected to have ARHL by 2025. 4     ARHL usually manifests \
as an irreversible, progressive disorder, with hearing loss beginning in the \
high-frequency range and gradually progressing to the low-frequency range. 5 \
Several recent studies have revealed that ARHL can cause cognitive impairment \
and that it is an independent high-risk factor for several neuropsychiatric \
disorders, including dementia, depression, and Alzheimer\[CloseCurlyQuote]s \
disease. 6 Uncorrected hearing loss not only affects physical and cognitive \
functions, but can also result in serious withdrawal from social activities. \

 Abstract     This study aims to provide a comprehensive picture of auditory \
emotion perception in cochlear implant (CI) users by (1) investigating \
emotion categorization in both vocal (pseudo-speech) and musical domains and \
(2) how individual differences in residual acoustic hearing, sensitivity to \
voice cues (voice pitch, vocal tract length), and quality of life (QoL) might \
be associated with vocal emotion perception and, going a step further, also \
with musical emotion perception. In 28 adult CI users, with or without \
self-reported acoustic hearing, we showed that sensitivity \
(d\[CloseCurlyQuote]) scores for emotion categorization varied largely across \
the participants, in line with previous research. However, within \
participants, the d\[CloseCurlyQuote] scores for vocal and musical emotion \
categorization were significantly correlated, indicating similar processing \
of auditory emotional cues across the pseudo-speech and music domains and \
robustness of the tests. Only for musical emotion perception, emotion \
d\[CloseCurlyQuote] scores were higher in implant users with residual \
acoustic hearing compared to no acoustic hearing. The voice pitch perception \
did not significantly correlate with emotion categorization in either domain, \
while the vocal tract length significantly correlated in both domains. For \
QoL, only the subdomain of Speech production ability, but not the overall QoL \
scores, correlated with vocal emotion categorization, partially supporting \
previous findings. Taken together, results indicate that auditory emotion \
perception is challenging for some CI users, possibly a consequence of how \
available the emotion-related cues are via electric hearing. Improving these \
cues, either via rehabilitation or training, may also help auditory emotion \
perception in CI users. Competing Interest Statement     The authors have \

 {"          Since the presence of tinnitus is not always associated with \
audiometric hearing loss, it has been hypothesized that hidden hearing loss \
may act as a potential trigger for increased central gain along the neural \
pathway leading to tinnitus perception. In recent years, the study of hidden \
hearing loss has improved with the discovery of cochlear synaptopathy and \
several objective diagnostic markers. This study investigated three potential \
markers of peripheral hidden hearing loss in subjects with tinnitus: extended \
high-frequency audiometric thresholds, the auditory brainstem response, and \
the envelope following response. In addition, speech intelligibility was \
measured as a functional outcome measurement of hidden hearing loss. To \
account for age-related hidden hearing loss, participants were grouped \
according to age, presence of tinnitus, and audiometric thresholds. Group \
comparisons were conducted to differentiate between age- and tinnitus-related \
effects of hidden hearing loss. All three markers revealed age-related \
differences, whereas no differences were observed between the tinnitus and \
non-tinnitus groups. However, the older tinnitus group showed improved \
performance on low-pass filtered speech in noise tests compared to the older \
non-tinnitus group. These low-pass speech in noise scores were significantly \
correlated with tinnitus distress, as indicated using questionnaires, and \
could be related to the presence of hyperacusis. Based on our observations, \
cochlear synaptopathy does not appear to be the underlying cause of tinnitus. \
The improvement in low-pass speech-in-noise could be explained by enhanced \
temporal fine structure encoding or hyperacusis. Therefore, we recommend that \
future tinnitus research takes into account age-related factors, explores \
low-frequency encoding, and thoroughly assesses hyperacusis.     Previous \
