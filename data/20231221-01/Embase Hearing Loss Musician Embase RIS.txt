N2  - BACKGROUND: Many studies have examined the perception of musical emotion using excerpts from familiar music that includes highly expressed emotions to classify emotional choices. However, using familiar music to study musical emotions in people with acquired hearing loss could produce ambiguous results as to whether the emotional perception is due to previous experiences or listening to the current musical stimuli. To overcome this limitation, we developed new musical stimuli to study emotional perception without the effects of episodic memory. METHODS: A musician was instructed to compose five melodies with evenly distributed pitches around 1 kHz. The melodies were created to express the emotions of happy, sad, angry, tender, and neutral. To evaluate whether these melodies expressed the intended emotions, two methods were applied. First, we classified the expressed emotions of melodies with selected musical features from 60 features using genetic algorithm-based k-nearest neighbors. Second, forty-four people with normal hearing participated in an online survey regarding the emotional perception of music based on dimensional and discrete approaches to evaluate the musical stimuli set. RESULTS: Twenty-four selected musical features produced classification for intended emotions with an accuracy of 76%. The results of the online survey in the normal hearing (NH) group showed that the intended emotions were selected significantly more often than the others. K-means clustering analysis revealed that melodies with arousal and valence ratings corresponded to representative quadrants of interest. Additionally, the applicability of the stimuli was tested in 4 individuals with high-frequency hearing loss. CONCLUSION: By applying the individuals with NH, the musical stimuli were shown to classify emotions with high accuracy, as expressed. These results confirm that the set of musical stimuli can be used to study the perceived emotion in music, demonstrating the validity of the musical stimuli, independent of innate musical bias such as due to episodic memory. Furthermore, musical stimuli could be helpful for further studying perceived musical emotion in people with hearing loss because of the controlled pitch for each emotion.

N2  - Music is among the most important artistic, cultural, and entertainment modalities in any society. With the proliferation of music genres and the technological advances that allow people to consume music in any location and at any time, music over-exposure has become a significant public health issue. Music-induced hearing loss has a great deal in common with noise-induced hearing loss. However, there are important differences that make music a unique insult to the auditory system and a unique threat to public health. Its unique properties also make it a potentially valuable asset in sound conditioning paradigms. This review discusses hearing loss from noise and music, comparing and contrasting the two. Recent research on music-induced hearing loss is reviewed, followed by discussion of the differences in music-induced hearing loss between performers and consumers. The review concludes with a discussion of the potential of music as a sound conditioning stimulus to protect against acquired hearing loss.

N2  - Introduction: Sensorineural hearing loss caused by exposure to noise is one of the most frequent causes of deafness. Professional musicians have significant occupational exposure to high levels of noise. Use of hearing protection among musicians could substantially prevent hearing damage, though the rate of use is quite low. Methods and material: A questionnaire on the use of protective hearing devices, hearing care, and subjective judgments of hearing difficulties was completed by a group of classical musicians from Spain. We analysed the frequency of device use by instrument based on contingency tables analysed by χ2 tests. Results: One hundred and ninety-four Spanish classical orchestral musicians voluntarily completed the questionnaire. The percentage of musicians who reported using hearing protection in our survey was very low and varied with the type of instrument played. However, we found a high prevalence of subjective auditory disorders within this group. Conclusion: Few Spanish musicians use hearing protection. Training on hearing-loss prevention in this field and better protective devices could increase device use and improve the auditory health of this group.

N2  - This study aimed to determine (a) the influence of noise exposure background (NEB) on the peripheral and central auditory system functioning and (b) the influence of NEB on speech recognition in noise abilities in student musicians. Twenty non-musician students with self-reported low NEB and 18 student musicians with self-reported high NEB completed a battery of tests that consisted of physiological measures, including auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) at three different stimulus rates (11.3 Hz, 51.3 Hz, and 81.3 Hz), and P300, and behavioral measures including conventional and extended high-frequency audiometry, consonant–vowel nucleus–consonant (CNC) word test and AzBio sentence test for assessing speech perception in noise abilities at −9, −6, −3, 0, and +3 dB signal to noise ratios (SNRs). The NEB was negatively associated with performance on the CNC test at all five SNRs. A negative association was found between NEB and performance on the AzBio test at 0 dB SNR. No effect of NEB was found on the amplitude and latency of P300 and the ABR wave I amplitude. More investigations of larger datasets with different NEB and longitudinal measurements are needed to investigate the influence of NEB on word recognition in noise and to understand the specific cognitive processes contributing to the impact of NEB on word recognition in noise.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to establish whether preferred music-listening level differed between musicians and non-musicians, and whether preferred music-listening level was related to music genre preference and lifetime noise exposure. Seventeen musicians (mean age = 29.06 years, SD = 4.74; female n = 9) and 17 non-musicians (mean age = 28.94 years, SD = 4.63; female n = 9) with clinically normal hearing were recruited to listen to six music samples from different genres and one sample of environmental sounds. Participants adjusted the listening level [dB(A)] until the music was loud and enjoyable. This was repeated three times and an average was taken. Lifetime noise exposure was estimated using the Noise Exposure Structured Interview. Preferred music-listening levels of musicians were significantly higher than non-musicians. The preferred music-listening level differed with genre preference, with the participants’ favorite tracks being played at 11 dB higher level than the least favorite tracks. There was also a positive correlation between lifetime noise exposure and preferred music-listening level. Musicians prefer to listen to music at higher level than non-musicians and thus may be more susceptible to noise induced hearing loss than non-musicians. As such, musicians in particular would benefit from simple changes in lifestyle and listening habits, including increased awareness of the risks of higher listening levels, as well as the use of hearing protection.

N2  - Purpose: The aim of this study was to examine whether the medial olivocochlear hearing system functions, the high frequency hearing thresholds and speech discrimination in noise performance can guide us in assessing the risk of hearing loss among violinists. It is aimed to investigate possible hearing damage that is not reflected in pure tone hearing thresholds in violinists. Methods: The participants (n = 50) who have normal hearing and the ages of 18–30 were included in this study in two groups: violinists and controls who are unrelated to music. High frequency audiometer, auditory figure ground test (AFG) for speech discrimination in noise performance, Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emission (DPOAE) and contralateral suppression on DPOAE for medial olivocochlear system function tests were applied to all participants as well as routine audiological tests. Results: The high frequency hearing thresholds were obtained higher in violinists compared to the controls. In violinists, the AFG test scores and the suppression amount at 1 kHz were lower than the controls. In addition, DPOAE responses at 4–6 kHz were obtained lower in violinists (p < 0.05). Conclusion: The reason for high frequency hearing loss, decreased DPOAE response amplitudes, and poor medial olivocochlear function in violinists can be explained by the long-term exposure to high-level noise caused by the violin, one of the closest musical instruments. Routine and comprehensive audiological follow-up is crucial for musicians.

N2  - Congenital amusia is a neurodevelopmental disorder of music processing, which includes impaired pitch memory, associated to abnormalities in the right fronto-temporal network. Previous research has shown that tonal structures (as defined by the Western musical system) improve short-term memory performance for short tone sequences (in comparison to atonal versions) in non-musician listeners, but the tonal structures only benefited response times in amusic individuals. We here tested the potential benefit of tonal structures for short-term memory with more complex musical material. Congenital amusics and their matched non-musician controls were required to indicate whether two excerpts were the same or different. Results confirmed impaired performance of amusic individuals in this short-term memory task. However, most importantly, both groups of participants showed better memory performance for tonal material than for atonal material. These results revealed that even amusics’ impaired short-term memory for pitch shows classical characteristics of short-term memory, that is the mnemonic benefit of structure in the to-be-memorized material. The findings show that amusic individuals have acquired some implicit knowledge of regularities of their culture, allowing for implicit processing of tonal structures, which benefits to memory even for complex material.

N2  - Accurate and objective assessment of higher order auditory processing is challenging and mainly relies on evaluations that require a subjects’ active participation in tests such as frequency discrimination or speech perception in noise. This study investigates the value of cortical auditory evoked potentials (CAEPs) evoked in response to auditory change stimuli, known as acoustic change complexes (ACCs), as an objective measurement of auditory performance in hearing impairment. Secondary objectives were to assess the effect of hearing loss and non-professional musical experience on the ACC, and compare the ACC to the ‘conventional’ CAEP evoked in response to stimulus onset. In 24 normal-hearing subjects, consisting of 12 musicians and 12 non-musicians, and 13 age-matched hearing-impaired subjects ACCs were recorded in response to 12% frequency increases at four base frequencies (0.5, 1, 2 and 4 kHz). ACC amplitudes and latencies were compared to frequency discrimination thresholds at each base frequency, and to speech perception in noise. Frequency discrimination and speech perception in noise were significantly better for larger ACC N1-P2 amplitudes and shorter N1 latencies, whereas both frequency discrimination and speech perception did not correlate with onset CAEP amplitude or latency. Multiple regression analysis for prediction of speech perception in noise revealed that the strongest model was obtained by averaging over three frequencies (1, 2 and 4 kHz) with two significant predictors: hearing loss (R2 = 0.52) and ACC latency (R2 = 0.35). Thus, explaining 87% of the variance, this model indicates that subjects with longer ACC latencies have worse speech perception in noise than subjects with comparable hearing thresholds and shorter ACC latencies. If hearing loss was removed from this model, the combination of ACC amplitude and latency over those three frequencies explained 74% of the total variance in speech perception in noise. There were no differences in frequency discrimination, speech perception, CAEP, or ACC between recreational musicians and non-musicians. We conclude that the objective ACC N1 latency is a good predictor of speech perception in noise. When confirmed in validation studies with larger numbers of subjects, it can aid clinicians in their evaluation of auditory performance and higher order processing, in particular when behavioral testing is unreliable.

N2  - Beethoven suffered from episodes of severe diarrhoea starting in his late teens, and increasing deafness from around the age of 28. He died from cirrhosis of the liver at the age of 57 in 1827. The nature of his diseases has been controversial ever since. Until recently, no one has invoked a single disease that would explain the chronic afflictions of his bowel, ears and liver. Suggested diagnoses have included lead poisoning, alcoholic cirrhosis, viral hepatitis, inflammatory eye disease, rheumatism, inflammatory bowel disease, Paget's disease of bone, Cogan's syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, otosclerosis, chronic pancreatitis, tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, Whipple's disease, renal papillary necrosis and syphilis. In 2005, Karmody and Bachor suggested that Beethoven suffered from chronic ulcerative colitis and its sequels. It is now known that ulcerative colitis may be complicated by sensorneural deafness and sclerosing cholangitis which progresses to cirrhosis, liver failure and death. These apparently diverse diseases are now believed to share an autoimmune pathogenesis. This explanation neatly joins together Beethoven's triad of diarrhoea, deafness and cirrhosis.

N2  - High-fidelity premolded earplugs (HiFi HPDs) are designed to provide relatively uniform attenuation across frequencies. The primary goal of this study was to verify the amount and flatness of individual user attenuation. HiFi HPD attenuation was measured using real-ear attenuation at threshold (REAT) measurements under circumaural earphones. Participants were 16 adults tested using commercial HiFi HPDs marketed for use at recreational music events and/or for use by musicians. There was significant individual variation in attenuation both within and across HiFi HPD brands. In addition to significant differences in achieved attenuation, there were significant differences in the uniformity of the attenuation. These data suggest verification of attenuation is important in musicians who are at risk for music-induced hearing disorders even when using "over-the-counter"uniform-fit HPDs.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: The U.S. Department of Defense employs more musicians than any other organization in the USA with over 6,000 musicians employed. Musculoskeletal pathologies, behavioral health disorders, hearing loss, and dystonias account for the majority of reasons a musician seek medical care. The aim of this study is to review recent medical literature documenting occupational hazards in musicians. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Authors performed a literature review of publications related to musician performance-related musculoskeletal disorders (PRMDs) and performance-related pain (PRP), behavioral health disorders, dystonias, and hearing loss, published from 2004 to 2019 PubMed. RESULTS: The search returned 174 possible articles which, after review and exclusion, yielded 88 articles. CONCLUSIONS: Medical literature suggests several risk factors for multiple disease categories. Practice time and history of PRMD/PRP were both associated with development of PRMD/PRP and focal dystonia. A history of behavioral health disorder was associated with development of focal dystonia. Clinicians should counsel their musician patients on strategies to minimize risks, and additional research is needed to identify specific causes of illnesses in musician populations.

N2  - Introduction: The aims of this study were to detect hearing loss in professional musicians and to assess its importance according to the duration of exposure and the intensity of the noise suffered. Materiel and methods: this cross-sectional epidemiological survey involved 241 musicians aged> 20 years with professional seniority> 2 years. The study included an analysis of working conditions with noise metrology (standard NF EN ISO 9612) and a medical assessment (questionnaire, clinical examination and audiometry). Results: The average age was 43.6 ± 10.5 years, the average seniority was 20.1 ± 6.1 years and the average weekly working time was 33.8 hours. The instruments played were percussion (49.4%), strings (29.4%), winds (14.9%) and brass (5%). Personal and family history of deafness was found in 5% of musicians not playing amplified music at loud levels and 14.5% playing amplified music at loud levels. 24.5% had normal audiometry, 51% sensorineural hearing loss, 14.5% conductive hearing loss and 9.9% mixed hearing loss. Sound exposure measurement showed high values in orchestras not playing loudly amplified music with intensities of around 98 dB (A). LAeq (3h) sound levels ranged from 94 to 106 dB (A). The LAeq (3h) to which musicians from orchestras playing loudly amplified music were exposed were between 98 and 108 dB (A) indoors and exceeded 112 dB (A) during outdoor concerts Conclusions: There is no information campaign on the preventing hearing impairment amongst musicians in our country. The prevention approach will be more accepted and applied if the representatives of musicians are involved in its elaboration

N2  - Previous studies suggest that musicians may be at higher risk for a set of medical problems; however, this literature has been limited by relatively small sample sizes, self-reports, and lack of controls. To address such limitations, we examined trends in the medical care of musicians in an Electronic Health Record database. On the basis of a collection of keywords and regular expressions in the patients’ clinical notes, we identified 9803 “musicians” that we matched for sex, median age (across the medical record), ethnicity, race, the length of record, and the number of visits with 49,015 controls. We fitted 1263 logistic regression models to determine whether the phenotype was correlated with musicianship. Two hundred fifty-seven phenotypes were more prevalent in musicians than controls after Bonferroni adjustment (P < 7.6 × 10–6), including diseases of the larynx and vocal cords (OR = 2.32 (95% CI: 2.25–2.40)), and hearing loss (OR = 1.36 (95% CI: 1.32–1.39)). Fifteen phenotypes were significantly more prevalent in controls than musicians, including coronary atherosclerosis (OR = 0.91 (95% CI: 0.89–0.94)). Although being a musician was related to many occupational health problems, we identified protective effects of musicianship in which certain disorders were less common in musicians than in controls, indicating that active musical engagement could have health benefits analogous to athletic engagement.

N2  - Significant problems have plagued medical and musicological researchers who wish to understand the complexities of Beethoven’s physical and mental health. The most significant is a lack of detailed information on the composer’s medical and mental conditions as they appeared and progressed. Though he consistently saw well-regarded doctors from around 1800 to his death, only one wrote a detailed description and only a few left information in the conversation books. Other problems are the limited medical knowledge about certain diseases at the time (such as the causes of deafness) and treatments with no or limited effectiveness (both for deafness and liver disease, for instance). Two additional problems are the focus of this essay. The first is the fact that studying the composer’s health and diseases is a cross-disciplinary endeavor that requires specialized knowledge both of medical science and of musicological expertise into every corner of Beethoven’s biography. The second concerns acquiring a knowledge of all the available sources that have survived to document the composer’s health and a critical assessment of their value.

N2  - Biographical accounts of famous artists usually try to relate the life story to the works (and vice versa). This gives the work a special “colour”, often the context for understanding for today’s recipients. This interrelation is complex and often judgmental, sometimes manipulative. Thus, medical (including psychiatric), characterological and psychodynamic assessments and interpretations must be made with great caution. Primary sources may be scanty and diagnostic concepts may have changed (Mozart died of hitzigem Frieselfieber [prickly heat fever]; in Hölderlin’s lifetime, schizophrenia or bipolar disorder did not yet “exist”). The attempt at a diagnostic classification often says more about the author and his time than about the artist (for example, the assessment of Robert Schumann’s or Friedrich Hölderlin’s mental illness). Against this background, elements of Ludwig van Beethoven’s biography are presented from a psychiatric perspective. In summary, Beethoven can be diagnosed with an alcohol use disorder. A pronounced hyperthymic temperament is likely to have had a clearly positive influence on the course of the disorder. In particular, no influence of the alcohol use disorder on the musical quality of the work can be proven. A clear episodic course of affective symptoms as in bipolar disorder is not demonstrable. The deafness caused a severe reduction in quality of life.

N2  - Introduction Several studies document the occurrence of hearing problems in musicians due to the constant exposure of loud sounds during activities such as group rehearsals, music performances and individual practices. Most of them reveal that many musicians are unaware of the risks faced in making music and are resistant to preventive actions. However, it seems reasonable to reverse this context based on the development of preventive actions during the graduation time of this public. Objectives To suggest a protocol of educational actions regarding hearing health with professors from higher education institutions in music. Methods The elaboration of the protocol of educational actions in hearing health was based on active learning and problematizing methodologies, to happen through activities developed in the academic environment. Results The protocol was developed to be applied in six modules, with of 1 h 30 min each, and contemplates the following topics (1) notions of anatomy-physiology of hearing, effects of high sound intensity, control measures and means of prevention of hearing loss; (2) acoustic characteristics of the work environment and workload in practical music classes and/or supervising internships (3) workshops towards the use of sound pressure level measurement apps and hearing screening apps; (4) composition and recording of jingles and pod-casts related to the risks of exposure to high intensity music to play for music students. Conclusion The development of the activities planned in the protocol can lead professors to incorporate the concepts and attitudes related to hearing health, to act as promotion agents to positively influence new generations of musicians with regard to that matter. The results must be continuously evaluated to identify the weaknesses and potential of the protocol.

N2  - AIM: To investigate the impact of tinnitus on professional musicians in the UK. BACK-GROUND: Tinnitus is the experience of sound when an external source is absent, primarily associated with the ageing process, hearing loss, and noise exposure. Amongst populations exposed to industrial noise, noise exposure and noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) have been found to be the factors most associated with tinnitus. The risk of NIHL amongst professional musicians is greater than that amongst the general population, meaning they may be at increased risk of tinnitus. METHODS: Seventy-four professional musicians completed an online survey involving closed and open-ended questions, and completed the Tinnitus fuctional Index (TFI) questionnaire. Descriptive statistics and thematic analysis of open-ended qualitative responses were used to analyse the data. RESULTS: Three themes were generated from the analysis of the responses to the open-ended questions. These themes were: (1) the impact of tinnitus on the lives of professional musicians, (2) professional musician experience of tinnitus services, support, and hearing health and safety, and (3) the support professional musicians want. The mean global TFI score for professional musicians was 39.05, interpreted as tinnitus being a moderate problem. Comparisons with general population data revealed lower TFI scores for the TFI subscales of ‘sense of control’ and ‘intrusiveness’ for professional musicians and higher for auditory difficulties associated with tinnitus amongst professional musicians. CONCLU-SION: Tinnitus can negatively impact on professional musicians’ lives. There is a need for bespoke self-help groups, awareness raising, and education to prevent tinnitus and promote hearing health among musicians.

N2  - Although music therapy may engender clinical benefits in patients with neurodegenerative disease, the impacts of social and musical factors of such activities on socio-emotional and motor engagements are poorly understood. To address this issue, non-verbal behaviors of 97 patients with or without major cognitive impairment (CI) were assessed when listening to music or a metronome in front of a musician who was present physically (live) or virtually (video). Socio-emotional engagement was quantified as emotional facial expression production and gaze direction. Motor engagement was quantified as overall body motion and the production of rhythmic movements. In both groups, positive facial expressions were more frequent and rhythmic motor activities lasted longer with music than with a metronome, and during a live performance rather than a video performance. Relative to patients without CI, patients with CI moved less with music, expressed fewer emotions, and spent less time looking at the musician in the video condition and in the metronome condition. The relative reductions in motor and socio-emotional engagements in patients with CI might be markers of disease progression. However, the presence of a live partner induces older adults to engage emotionally and physically in musical activities emphasizing the relevance of using live performance as motivational levers during music therapy.

N2  - Purpose: To verify the auditory-perceptual and acoustic effects of the semioccluded vocal tract exercise with Finnish tube on the vocal quality of a deaf musician. Methods: A seven-day protocol with Finnish tube was performed with guidance for its home replication twice a day. A 46-years-old man with profound bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, musician and composer participated. Before and after the application of the protocol had undergone tonal audiometry, nasofibrolaryngoscopy, acoustic analysis with Praat and auditory-perceptual evaluation of the voice with Voice Profile Analysis Scheme for Brazilian Portuguese. Results: The postintervention auditory-perceptual analysis identified reduction of the deviation in lip spreading, extensive labial range, raised tongue body, pharyngeal expansion, nasal resonance, larynx height, larynx and vocal tract tension and irregularity, pitch, speech rate, and a better respiratory support. The maximum phonation time reduced, probably because of elimination of the abrupt vocal attack and tension, articulatory deviations, improvement in voicing and the absence of the use of expiratory reserve air. The fundamental frequency became lower, and the first, second, third, and fourth formants became higher. The jitter increased, and the shimmer reduced. Conclusion: The use of the Finnish tube might have facilitated the voicing sensations in the deaf musician, by enhancing the tactile-kinesthetic perception of the vocal tract and brought a greater source-filter interaction.

N2  - Daily activities performed by music instructors generate high sound levels that could potentially lead to overexposure. Adverse outcomes associated with high-exposure to sound, such as hearing loss and tinnitus, can be especially devastating to music instructors as hearing is essential to both job performance and career reward. The primary objective of this study was to compare sound exposures of music instructors to recommended exposure limits. Secondary objectives were to identify high-exposure activities and to evaluate potential similar exposure groups by examining between- and within-worker exposure variability. Personal sound exposure measurements from music instructors were collected using dosimeters during full workdays for up to 4 weeks over multiple semesters at a university's school of music. Study participants completed an activity log to record work-related activities throughout each day of sampling. Dosimeters logged 1-sec sound equivalent levels in A-weighted decibels. These data were used to calculate 8-hr time-weighted averages, daily dose, and activity-specific contributions to that dose to determine if daily exposures exceeded the recommended limit of 85 dBA and to identify high-exposure activities that could be targeted for future intervention. Seventeen participants were sampled for a total of 200 days. Approximately one-third of daily exposures exceeded recommended limits. The groups with the highest exposures were brass and conducting instructors. Conductors experienced the highest between-day variability in daily exposures. Activities that contributed the most to daily dose included group rehearsals, personal practice sessions, and performances, while classes and administrative work did not substantially contribute to daily dose. Daily exposures were highly variable, ranging from 60-95 dBA (mean = 81 dBA, sd = 8 dBA), and were influenced by instructional area and musical activity. Future exposure assessments for music instructors should include sampling for multiple days, and those above-recommended limits should be placed into hearing conservation programs.

N2  - Professional musicians are at high risk of developing tinnitus due to their over-exposure to music at both occupational and recreational level. This is a 5-year long prospective case series study performed in the Musicians/Performing Arts Medicine Clinic of the 1st Otorhinolaryngology Department of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. A total of 274 professional musicians underwent thorough medical history, history of music exposure, assessment of the impact their hearing status has on their professional life (Musicians Hearing Handicap Index), behavioral (Pure Tone Audiometry, standard and extended high frequency) and objective audiometric tests (TEOAE and DPOAE). Standard pure tone audiometry thresholds were correlated with the presence of tinnitus only at high frequencies. Musicians with tinnitus had a clinical and significant higher MHHI score and the incidence of tinnitus was significantly higher in participants suffering from musculoskeletal disease and those with abnormal PTA. Participants' hours of practice were similar in those with tinnitus and those without. The tinnitus group (and in order of descending effect size) had significantly worse thresholds in high frequency audiometry (≥ 3000 Hz) as well as lower signal to noise ratios in DPOAE at almost all frequencies and in TEOAE at high frequencies (2.8 and 4 kHz). A subgroup analysis of the musicians with normal PTA, showed that those with tinnitus showed elevated thresholds in the extended high frequency. In conclusion, tinnitus occurrence in musicians with normal audiogram is potentially correlated with high frequency hearing loss and impaired otoacoustic emissions and these two examinations should be considered in this group.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Does wearing musicians’ earplugs while performing affect the quality of the performance? Can listeners perceive a difference in sound when musicians are performing with or without earplugs? The risk of hearing loss is a concern for musicians, but some are reluctant to wear hearing protection due to factors such as an inability to hear their own instrument properly and the possibility of decreased sound quality for listeners. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of musicians’ earplugs on instrumental pitch accuracy and the perception of tone quality, intonation, and dynamic contrast, as perceived by musicians and listeners. METHODS: Ten university studio faculty teachers were recorded performing single pitches and lyrical and technical passages, first without earplugs and then immediately after with earplugs. A sample of 8 studio faculty teachers and 88 undergraduate music education students completed a researcher-created music perception test of tone quality, intonation, and dynamic contrast. RESULTS: Objective analyses of the single pitch recordings made by faculty with and without earplugs indicate that pitch accuracy did not favor either condition consistently. Results from the perception test indicate that although both faculty and student listeners perceived some differences, the most frequent perception was that the audio pair was equal, and there was no clear difference between performing with and without earplugs in terms of tone quality, intonation, or dynamic contrast. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that musicians should feel confident that wearing musicians’ earplugs while performing does not adversely affect pitch accuracy or listeners’ perceptions of their timbre and dynamic control.

N2  - Performing artists are a unique subset of athletes. With the highly repetitive nature of performance training, emphasis on proper technique, ergonomics, and preventive cross-training is vital, as many injuries are due to overuse or poor technique. There are novel medical concerns in performers, including ENT problems, mental health concerns and substance use risks. While music is central to performances, it is also a treatment modality to address cognitive, sensory, and motor dysfunctions in certain neurological conditions. Due to this wide array of issues, it is imperative to understand the specific needs and risks of performers to provide optimal medical care.

N2  - Pitch perception modifications are among the little-known adverse effects observed with antiepileptics, mainly affecting patients treated with carbamazepine (CBZ). Here, we describe an original French case of pitch perception modification due to CBZ resulting in perfect pitch loss. We also reviewed the literature as well as French and world health organisation global pharmacovigilance database. The case report concerns a 22-year-old patient with perfect pitch with untreated left temporal partial epilepsy. Following a generalized seizure, the introduction of CBZ prolonged release (200 mg twice a day) is decided. As soon as CBZ is introduced, the patient notices a change in pitch perception, about a semitone lower. This adverse effect persisted despite a gradual decrease in doses. The patient reported a total recovery of his perfect pitch when CBZ stopped completely 11 years later. In the French pharmacovigilance database, only one other case of pitch perception modification under CBZ was recorded (no cases were found with oxcarbazepine, lacosamide, sodium valproate, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone, ethosuximide, vigabatrine, felbamate, gabapentin, tiagabine and topiramate). In the literature, 27 cases of pitch perception modification have been published with CBZ, 1 case with oxcarbazepine and 1 case with lacosamide. Pitch perception modification is a very rare adverse effect of CBZ, oxcarbazepine and lacosamide, identified in the literature mainly in the Japanese population, in experienced musicians. A rapid onset after the introduction of treatment, a complete resolution of symptoms, in most cases upon discontinuation of treatment, is observed, with no sequelae reported. Due to the impact on quality of life, especially in patients whose profession is related to music, knowledge of this adverse event seems important to evoke this diagnosis.

N2  - Objective: To reduce the risk of hearing injury, musicians are often recommended custom-made musicians' hearing protectors (MHP). Studies report benefits of use however, many still report challenges leading to relatively low uptake and inconsistent usage. Person-centred approaches to health have been shown to improve patient outcomes, and these principles may be translatable to musicians' hearing care. The aim was to investigate if use of, and satisfaction with, MHP is influenced by the treatment delivered to musicians by audiologists.Design: Participants were randomly allocated to one of four conditions that varied in extent of person-centred care.Study sample: Forty-two musicians with an interest in purchasing MHP were recruited.Results: Satisfaction with MHP was high overall and users reported a reduction in incidence of tinnitus. Participants reported few issues related to sound quality, however insertion difficulty was the main problem reported. Only one musician self-identified the need for alterations to their MHP.Conclusions: Adoption of person-centred approaches to MHP was not found to increase likelihood of use, however, satisfaction was high across all conditions. Most often, the need for MHP alterations were clinician-identified during fitting appointments or follow-up contact, underscoring the importance of including these components when providing audiological services to musicians.

N2  - Background: Musicians are known to be at risk for developing hearing sensitivity and hearing-related problems given their occupational exposure to high-level sound. Among options for hearing conservation, earplugs are an effective and inexpensive choice. Adoption rates for musicians' earplugs remains consistently low, however, given concerns about the impact of hearing protection on their own performance as well as concerns that the resultant music will be a negative experience for listeners. In fact, few studies have (1) examined musicians' attitudes about using hearing protection while performing themselves and (2) determined whether music played by musicians wearing hearing protection sounds different to listeners. Purpose: The purposes of this study were (1) to evaluate how wearing musicians' earplugs affected musicians' perception of their performance while they were playing, and (2) to examine whether listeners can distinguish a difference between music recorded by musicians playing with and without earplugs. Research Design: Experiment 1: student musicians were recorded playing under two conditions (with and without wearing earplugs) and then were surveyed about their experience. Experiment 2: musically experienced and naïve listeners were presented with musical samples played by musicians with and without earplugs in an ABX format. Listeners responded by indicating whether the third stimulus (X) was conditionally identical to the first (A) or second stimulus (B). Results: Experiment 1: while performing, musicians always preferred the no earplugs condition. The majority, however, rated the overall experience of playing with earplugs as generally positive. Experiment 2: listeners were unable to hear a difference between the two recordings. Discussion: In this experiment, musicians rated their experience playing without hearing protection more favorably than their experience playing with hearing protection, but most musicians rated their experience with hearing protection as generally positive. The inability of listeners to distinguish a difference in music played with and without hearing protection suggests that the listening experience may not be adversely impacted by hearing protection worn by the performers. Conclusion: Earplugs are an inexpensive, noninvasive strategy for hearing conservation for musicians, and this study indicates that barriers to wearing hearing protection might be less problematic than previously reported.

N2  - Musicians are at risk of hearing loss due to prolonged noise exposure, but they may also be at risk of early sub-clinical hearing damage, such as cochlear synaptopathy. In the current study, we investigated the effects of noise exposure on electrophysiological, behavioral and self-report correlates of hearing damage in young adult (age range = 18–27 years) musicians and non-musicians with normal audiometric thresholds. Early-career musicians (n = 76) and non-musicians (n = 47) completed a test battery including the Noise Exposure Structured Interview, pure-tone audiometry (PTA; 0.25–8 kHz), extended high-frequency (EHF; 12 and 16 kHz) thresholds, otoacoustic emissions (OAEs), auditory brainstem responses (ABRs), speech perception in noise (SPiN), and self-reported tinnitus, hyperacusis and hearing in noise difficulties. Total lifetime noise exposure was similar between musicians and non-musicians, the majority of which could be accounted for by recreational activities. Musicians showed significantly greater ABR wave I/V ratios than non-musicians and were also more likely to report experience of - and/or more severe - tinnitus, hyperacusis and hearing in noise difficulties, irrespective of noise exposure. A secondary analysis revealed that individuals with the highest levels of noise exposure had reduced outer hair cell function compared to individuals with the lowest levels of noise exposure, as measured by OAEs. OAE level was also related to PTA and EHF thresholds. High levels of noise exposure were also associated with a significant increase in ABR wave V latency, but only for males, and a higher prevalence and severity of hyperacusis. These findings suggest that there may be sub-clinical effects of noise exposure on various hearing metrics even at a relatively young age, but do not support a link between lifetime noise exposure and proxy measures of cochlear synaptopathy such as ABR wave amplitudes and SPiN. Closely monitoring OAEs, PTA and EHF thresholds when conventional PTA is within the clinically ‘normal’ range could provide a useful early metric of noise-induced hearing damage. This may be particularly relevant to early-career musicians as they progress through a period of intensive musical training, and thus interventions to protect hearing longevity may be vital.

N2  - Exposure to loud music—due to widespread personal music players (PMPs) and noisy leisure activities—are major risk factors for noise induced hearing loss (NIHL) in adolescents. However, there is little evidence of the impact of noise on the hearing of younger children. This study aimed to explore an association between PMP use and hearing, and to identify other sources of noise among children. The study sample consisted of 1032 children aged 11–12 years old. Hearing thresholds were determined from 0.5 to 8 kHz. PMP use and other noise exposures were evaluated using a survey. We found that 82% of the children had a PMP, and 78% were exposed to noise when playing computer games. An audiometric notch was documented in 1.3% of the children. Only 11.5% of the children ever used hearing protection while engaged in noisy activities. We found no convincing evidence of an association between PMP use and hearing thresholds, although our results suggest that tinnitus may be an early sign of NIHL in young children. The study shows a need to provide children, their parents, and educators with knowledge of how to take care of hearing, including how to avoid and minimize noise exposure.

N2  - AIMS: Classical guitarists may experience unique occupational health problems due to a constellation of biopsychosocial demands associated with the physical characteristics of the classical guitar, performance techniques, repertoire, and performance practices consistent with the classical music genre. Unfortunately, epidemiologic studies of classical guitarists are limited. The purpose of this study was to examine musculoskeletal and non-musculoskeletal problems in classical guitarists. METHODS: A sample of 190 classical guitarists completed a web-based survey. The survey assessed demographics, music-related variables, musician identity, non-musculoskeletal problems, and site-specific pain. Novel interactive body and hand maps were deployed to assess site-specific frequency, intensity, influence on playing, and quality of pain. RESULTS: A total of 168 subjects (88.9%) reported experiencing classical guitar-related pain in the past year at one or more musculoskeletal sites. The left thenar (25%) was the most prevalent pain site. Pain at the right upper back was reported to influence performance the most. Classical guitarists reported problems with non-musculoskeletal problems at rates similar or higher to other instrument-specific groups. CONCLUSION: Classical guitarists are an understudied group of musicians who experience occupational health problems. The novel assessment protocols developed for this study produced outcomes that may be helpful to both clinicians and pedagogues. Med Probl Perform Art 2020;35(3):167-179.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Speech comprehension under "cocktail party" scenarios deteriorates with age even in the absence of measurable hearing loss. Musical training is suggested to counteract the age-related decline in speech-in-noise (SIN) perception, yet which aspect of musical plasticity contributes to this compensation remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effects of musical experience and aging on SIN perception ability. We hypothesized a key mediation role of auditory working memory in ameliorating deficient SIN perception in older adults by musical training. DESIGN: Forty-eight older musicians, 29 older nonmusicians, 48 young musicians, and 24 young nonmusicians all with (near) normal peripheral hearing were recruited. The SIN task was recognizing nonsense speech sentences either perceptually colocated or separated with a noise masker (energetic masking) or a two-talker speech masker (informational masking). Auditory working memory was measured by auditory digit span. Path analysis was used to examine the direct and indirect effects of musical expertise and age on SIN perception performance. RESULTS: Older musicians outperformed older nonmusicians in auditory working memory and all SIN conditions (noise separation, noise colocation, speech separation, speech colocation), but such musician advantages were absent in young adults. Path analysis showed that age and musical training had opposite effects on auditory working memory, which played a significant mediation role in SIN perception. In addition, the type of musical training did not differentiate SIN perception regardless of age. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide evidence that musical training offsets age-related speech perception deficit at adverse listening conditions by preserving auditory working memory. Our findings highlight auditory working memory in supporting speech perception amid competing noise in older adults, and underline musical training as a means of "cognitive reserve" against declines in speech comprehension and cognition in aging populations.

N2  - 2020 marks the 250th anniversary of Ludwig van Beethoven's birthday. The composer's hearing impairment is probably the most well-known disorder of a musician. For more than 200 years, the underlying cause of his deafness has been studied, but still not fully understood. In this context, the question arises as to how far the currently available measures of hearing rehabilitation would made it possible for the musician to receive satisfactory treatment. On the basis of primary sources, such as letters from the composer, written documents from his contemporaries and, in particular, Beethoven's detailed autopsy report and subsequent clinical examinations of his skull, the development of his hearing impairment is examined, the most likely causes are evaluated and classified in the context of further illnesses. In the differential diagnosis, syphilis, chronic lead intoxication, osteodystrophia deformans, otosclerosis, and autoimmune inflammation of the inner ear are discussed as possible causes of hearing impairment of the musician. In the course of the discussion, the existing studies on the individual differential diagnoses are presented and critically classified in terms of their justifiability and relevance. In addition, the potential benefit of a cochlear implantation is estimated for the composer.

N2  - Background: Sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) is defined as an acute onset of greater than 30 decibel hearing loss in at least 3 consecutive frequencies. It occurs at a rate of approximately 2-20 per 100,000 persons worldwide and is a medical emergency. Primary causes include viral infections, vascular events, neurological incidents, autoimmune disease, medications and idiopathic causes which represent the majority. Per 2019 AAO-HNSF guidelines, persons that present with sudden hearing loss should promptly be assessed by ENT with audiometry, head CT and MRI. Treatment includes systemic corticosteroids, intratympanic corticosteroids as well as hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Although a proportion of individuals that suffer from SSNHL will have spontaneous recovery, many, including the person discussed here, do not recover. The aim of this case study is to highlight the importance of swift recognition and management of SSNHL. Methods/Case description: This case study examines SSNHL in a 71-year-old male. Upon initial presentation to ENT, he described dramatic hearing loss in his left ear. He had difficulty pinpointing the exact date of his first symptoms; however, they are likely to have occurred within 2-6 weeks of treatment initiation. His pertinent medical history included right sided squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx and radiation treatment. Relevant social history included extensive performances as a professional pianist. Results: Audiometry revealed asymmetric bilateral hearing loss. On the right, pure tone thresholds revealed mild sloping to severe sensorineural hearing loss. On the left, severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss. Both systemic and intratympanic steroids were begun immediately. He was counseled to have an MRI at the time of diagnosis; however, this was ultimately never completed. Four weeks following initial diagnosis and treatment, follow-up audiometry was conducted which revealed minimal improvement. Conclusions: These findings underscore the importance of early recognition and management of SSNHL. Of note, audiometry data from this individual in the years preceding his SSNHL, revealed that he had presbycusis. The implication for clinical practice being that these are not mutually exclusive events and one should always consider SSNHL in the setting of acute hearing loss in a patient with or without pre-existing presbycusis.

N2  - Purpose: Although findings in human studies trying to identify signs of cochlear synaptopathy (CS) are still controversial, several methodological restrictions exist, including inconsistencies in participants profiles, definition of study groups and inclusion criteria, diverse electrophysiological measurements settings and noise exposure history metrics and participants’ age range, which question the reliability of conclusions. Method: Two groups of individuals aged 18–41 participated in this study. The first group consisted of 24 musicians with well documented occupational noise exposure and the second one of 24 healthy controls. Groups were matched for age and gender. Inclusion criteria were normal and symmetrical pure tone audiometry and extended high frequency audiometry thresholds, as well as present and normal TEOAEs and DPOAEs. Outcome measures included SNR scores of speech in bubble audiometry and auditory brainstem response waves I, II and V amplitudes and latencies at three different presentation rates: 11, 33 and 44 clicks/s. Results: Wave I amplitude in musicians was significantly lower compared to controls at all presentation rates (11/s: p.043, 33/s: p.007 and 44/s: p.014). There was also a significantly greater reduction in wave I amplitude as well as in wave &Iota;/V amplitude ratio in the 33/s stimulus presentation in musicians compared to the control group (p.02 and.01, respectively). Finally, lower wave I amplitudes were found in musicians with auditory symptoms compared to musicians without symptoms at the 44/s presentation rate (p =.002). Conclusion: The ABR findings in our study are suggestive of possible increased prevalence of CS in musicians. Wave I amplitude was lower in Musicians group compared to matched controls. Furthermore, there was a greater reduction of wave I amplitude and wave &Iota;/V amplitude ratio at higher stimulation rates, which would support their use in CS studies.

N2  - Today, due to the growth of industries and spread of the use of various instruments and devices that produce high noise levels, it is necessary to pay more attention to the effects of exposure to noise on organs and tissues in the body. The importance of the immune system in fighting external and pathogenic factors has raised the need to consider external factors (such as harmful physical factors) and make efforts to avoid producing them. In this systematic review, 811 potentially relevant studies were found in Google Scholar, PubMed, and Web of Science databases, of which 32 different English-written articles were included in the study. The method of searching and systematically reviewing articles was based on the assessment tool of the multiple systematic reviews (AMSTAR) method. The results of this study suggested that noise could affect the function of the immune system and its components by affecting other systems and organs of the body, including the central nervous system, auditory system, circulatory system, and endocrine gland. Moreover, it can be hypothesized that noise affects immune system by producing the NADPH oxidase (Nox) and reactive oxygen species (ROS).

N2  - Pitch perception modifications are among the little-known adverse effects observed with antiepileptics, mainly affecting patients treated with carbamazepine (CBZ). Here, we describe an original French case of pitch perception modification due to CBZ resulting in perfect pitch loss. We also reviewed the literature as well as French and world health organisation global pharmacovigilance database. The case report concerns a 22-year-old patient with perfect pitch with untreated left temporal partial epilepsy. Following a generalized seizure, the introduction of CBZ prolonged release (200 mg twice a day) is decided. As soon as CBZ is introduced, the patient notices a change in pitch perception, about a semitone lower. This adverse effect persisted despite a gradual decrease in doses. The patient reported a total recovery of his perfect pitch when CBZ stopped completely 11 years later. In the French pharmacovigilance database, only one other case of pitch perception modification under CBZ was recorded (no cases were found with oxcarbazepine, lacosamide, sodium valproate, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone, ethosuximide, vigabatrine, felbamate, gabapentin, tiagabine and topiramate). In the literature, 27 cases of pitch perception modification have been published with CBZ, 1 case with oxcarbazepine and 1 case with lacosamide. Pitch perception modification is a very rare adverse effect of CBZ, oxcarbazepine and lacosamide, identified in the literature mainly in the Japanese population, in experienced musicians. A rapid onset after the introduction of treatment, a complete resolution of symptoms, in most cases upon discontinuation of treatment, is observed, with no sequelae reported. Due to the impact on quality of life, especially in patients whose profession is related to music, knowledge of this adverse event seems important to evoke this diagnosis.

N2  - Purpose The purpose of this study was to evaluate potential group differences between musicians and nonmusicians in their self-adjusted (SA) gain and compression settings for both music and speech stimuli. Speech recognition, sound quality, and strength of preference for the SA settings and the original prescriptive (National Acoustic Laboratories-Nonlinear 2 [NAL-NL2]) settings were also compared. Method Participants included 12 musician ( M = 60 years) and 12 nonmusician ( M = 55 years) adult hearing aid users with mild-moderate hearing loss, on average. Self-adjustments were made to hearing aid gain and compression settings for 2 music stimuli and a speech stimulus. Speech recognition in quiet and noise, sound quality for 6 dimensions (clarity, pleasantness, naturalness, fullness, brightness, and overall impression), and strength of preference ratings using paired comparisons were then assessed at both the NAL-NL2 settings and the participants' SA settings. Results On average, self-adjustments made by both groups were quite small (< 5 dB for gain and < 0.5 for compression ratio). Furthermore, SA changes to gain and compression ratio were not significantly different for musicians versus nonmusicians or for music versus speech. Finally, speech perception performance and sound quality ratings did not differ for the SA settings versus the NAL-NL2 settings, with the exception of the naturalness sound quality dimension. Conclusions These data suggest that a gain-frequency response specific to musicians and/or music inputs may not be necessary. Thus, current, validated prescriptive methods continue to be well supported as an appropriate starting place for listeners with mild-moderate hearing loss using open hearing aid fittings.

N2  - Introduction: Carbamazepine is a widely prescribed drug used in several indications, including the treatment of epilepsy. Its safety profile includes sensory impairment, especially hearing disorders such as tinnitus or hearing loss. We report here a case of pitch perception modification in a carbamazepine treated patient and describe pharmacovigilance data. Material and methods: The pharmacovigilance data review was performed using PubMed and the French Pharmacovigilance database (firstly with carbamazepine as suspected drug, and secondly with other anti-epileptic drugs) as regards the audition/hear disorders up to November 28, 2018. Results: Case report: A 22-year-old man, an absolute ear musician, developed a pitch perception change (a semitone lower) following carbamazepine initiation (no delay specified) used for partial epilepsy. The treatment was continued. Eleven years later, the drug withdrawal was associated with fast complete resolution. In the literature, we found 27 cases of pitch perception modification in carbamazepine users, mostly treated for epilepsia [1,2]; surprisingly, except for 2 of them, all were Japanese. With female predominance, mean age was 19 years. Carbamazepine plasma level was mostly in the therapeutic range. The modified pitch perception was mostly semitone lower. On the other hand, the magnitude of the shift is described as increasing with the stimulus increasing fundamental frequency [3]. Delay onset varied from few hours to 2 weeks after carbamazepine administration; resolution was observed after discontinuation of treatment. Furthermore, except one case reported with oxcarbazepine, this effect is not described with other antiepileptics [2]. The pathophysiologic mechanism has not been elucidated, although several hypotheses have been raised [1-3]. In the pharmacovigilance national database, only one case of pitch perception disorder was reported in a 12-year-old child, with an absolute ear, occurring one hour after carbamazepine initiation. The drug stop three weeks later was associated with fast (2 days) resolution. No case was identified with other antiepileptic drugs. Discussion/Conclusion: Despite a well description in the literature, especially in Japanese musician patients, the pitch perception modification is a very rare side effect of carbamazepine. Complete resolution is observed after drug continuation and no sequelae are reported to our best knowledge.

N2  - A risk factor shared by all musicians is a potential for noise-induced hearing loss. A study was conducted to explore what factors determine noise dosage during musical events experienced by college student musicians. First, noise exposure during specific activities was explored, including during ensemble rehearsal and personal practice. Next, full-day noise exposure was investigated by measuring levels experienced by student musicians during a typical daily routine. Factors such as instrument played, type of activity, location within ensemble, and room environment were related to noise dosage. Disparities in results using different standards to calculate noise dosage were also explored. Risk of noise overexposure was found to be greater in some instrument classes, such as wind instruments, than in others, such as string instruments, and can yield vastly different results depending on the metric used for noise dosage calculation.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Uniform attenuation earplugs (UAE) theoretically provide near even attenuation across frequencies when built to a manufacturer's specifications. Unfortunately, there is no current research available confirming if custom-molded uniform attenuation earplugs (UAE) are made to specifications nor is there guidance available on clinical methods of measuring attenuation of uniform attenuation earplug (UAE) devices. The goal of this study was to evaluate different procedures for UAE verification and to determine the most accurate clinically accessible verification protocol. DESIGN: Attenuation was measured using probe microphone techniques, as well as real-ear attenuation at threshold (REAT) measurements under circumaural earphones, soundfield speakers and supra-aural earphones. Comparisons were made to a reference system created in the laboratory. STUDY SAMPLE: Seventeen adult participants, totaling 30 ears. RESULTS: The results of this study demonstrate that the REAT measured in the soundfield using a narrowband noise stimulus with masking in the contralateral ear is currently the most accurate and widely available method of verifying UAEs. CONCLUSIONS: Factoring in clinical efficiency, the authors of this study recommend verifying attenuation levels using a soundfield REAT procedure as best clinical practice. In addition, the data suggests that REAT measurements under circumaural earphones are an acceptable second choice method.

N2  - Background: Hearing aids (HAs) are important for the rehabilitation of individuals with hearing loss. Although the rehabilitation of speech communication is well understood, less attention has been devoted to understanding hearing-impaired instrumentalists’ needs to actively participate in music. Despite efforts to adjust HA settings for music acoustics, there lacks an understanding of instrumentalists’ needs and if those HA adjustments satisfy their needs. Purpose: The purpose of the current study was to explore the challenges that adult HA-wearing instrumentalists face, which prevent them from listening, responding to, and performing music. Research Design: A qualitative methodology was employed with the use of semistructured interviews conducted with adult amateur instrumentalists. Study Sample: Twelve HA users who were amateur ensemble instrumentalists (playing instruments from the percussion, wind, reed, brass, and string families) and between the ages of 55 and 83 years (seven men and five women) provided data for analysis in this study. Amateur in this context was defined as one who engaged mindfully in pursuit of an activity. Data Collection and Analysis: Semistructured interviews were conducted using an open-ended interview guide. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Transcripts were analyzed using conventional qualitative content analysis. Results: Three categories emerged from the data: (1) participatory needs, (2) effects of HA use, and (3) effects of hearing loss. Participants primarily used HAs to hear the conductor’s instructions to meaningfully participate in music rehearsals. Effects of HA use fell within two subcategories: HA music sound quality and use of an HA music program. The effects of hearing loss fell within three subcategories: inability to identify missing information, affected music components, and nonauditory music perception strategies. Conclusions: Not surprisingly, hearing-impaired instrumentalists face challenges participating in their music activities. However, although participants articulated ways in which HAs and hearing loss affect music perception, which in turn revealed perspectives toward listening using the auditory system and other sensory systems, the primary motivation for their HA use was the need to hear the conductor’s directions. These findings suggest that providing hearing-impaired instrumentalists access to musical experience via participation should be prioritized above restoring the perception of musical descriptors. Future research is needed with instrumentalists who no longer listen to or perform music because of hearing loss, so that the relationship between musical auditory deficiencies and participation can be better explored.

N2  - Objectives: The purpose of this investigation was to assess the effects of earplugs on acoustical and perceptual measures of choral and solo sound. Methods: The researcher tested the effects of musician's earplugs on choral and solo timbre and singer perceptions. Members of an intact women's university choir recorded Dona Nobis Pacem under two conditions, no earplugs and with earplugs over time. Approximately half of the choir members also participated as soloists, recording Over the Rainbow under the same two conditions. All recordings were analyzed using long-term average spectra (LTAS). After participating in each recording session, the participants responded to a questionnaire about ability to hear self (solo and choral context) and ability to hear others (choral context) under two conditions, no earplugs and with earplugs. Results: LTAS results revealed that wearing earplugs in a choral setting caused decreased mean signal energy (>1 dB), resulting in less resonant singing. LTAS results also indicated that wearing earplugs in a solo setting had less effect on mean signal energy, resulting in a mean difference <1 dB in 3 of the 4 weeks studied. Singer questionnaire responses showed that wearing earplugs had a greater effect on participants' ability to hear others than it did on their ability to hear themselves. Conclusions: In the context of this study, it seems that wearing earplugs had more effect on timbre and the ability to receive sufficient auditory feedback in a choral setting than it did in a solo setting. Findings from this study could provide important information when structuring hearing conservation strategies.

N2  - Background: Some musicians may play the music louder while using earplugs thus reducing the effectiveness of the hearing protection offered by earplugs. In addition, the dynamic range (DR) of the music may be altered because of the use of earplugs with negative impact on perceived quality of music. There are some cultural differences in attitudes toward loudness, which may lead to differences in the loudness of music played by musicians from different cultures. Purpose: To investigate the effect of the use of two different types of earplugs on the loudness and DR of music played by musicians of Caucasian and Filipino origins. Research Design: Quasi-experimental repeated measures design. Study Sample: Thirty six musicians with normal hearing within the age range of 18–49 yr. Fifteen were of Caucasian (eight men and 7 women) origin and 21 were of the Filipino (nine men and 12 women) origin. Intervention: All participants received a brief educational session, which included information on music-induced hearing loss, the benefit of using earplugs, and the correct procedures for inserting and removing earplugs. They played music in five different conditions (three min each): Trial 1 of conventional and musicians’ earplugs in random order, no earplug, and trial 2 of conventional and musicians’ earplugs in random order. Data Collection and Analysis: Maximum, minimum, average (average sound level measured over the measurement period; LAVG), and peak levels were recorded using a dosimeter while playing music in each of the five conditions. The DR was derived by subtracting the minimum values from the maximum values. A different measure of the dynamic range 2 (DR2) was derived by subtracting the LAVG value from the peak value. Mixed analyses of variance (ANOVA) (Cultural origin and Gender as nonrepeated variables) was performed on LAVG, DR, and DR2. Results: Based on the LAVG levels yielded by them, 42–61% of the musicians may be at risk for hearing loss. The mixed ANOVA revealed some main effects of culture and some significant interactions involving cultural origin, the plug conditions, type of earplugs, and trial number. Conclusions: Use of earplugs may vary the overall loudness of music, the DR, or the DR2 in some musicians depending on the type of earplugs and cultural origin, and the effect may change with practice.

N2  - Several studies have shown that musical training leads to improved fundamental frequency (F0) discrimination for young listeners with normal hearing (NH). It is unclear whether a comparable effect of musical training occurs for listeners whose sensory encoding of F0 is degraded. To address this question, the effect of musical training was investigated for three groups of listeners (young NH, older NH, and older listeners with hearing impairment, HI). In a first experiment, F0 discrimination was investigated using complex tones that differed in harmonic content and phase configuration (sine, positive, or negative Schroeder). Musical training was associated with significantly better F0 discrimination of complex tones containing low-numbered harmonics for all groups of listeners. Part of this effect was caused by the fact that musicians were more robust than non-musicians to harmonic roving. Despite the benefit relative to their non-musicians counterparts, the older musicians, with or without HI, performed worse than the young musicians. In a second experiment, binaural sensitivity to temporal fine structure (TFS) cues was assessed for the same listeners by estimating the highest frequency at which an interaural phase difference was perceived. Performance was better for musicians for all groups of listeners and the use of TFS cues was degraded for the two older groups of listeners. These findings suggest that musical training is associated with an enhancement of both TFS cues encoding and F0 discrimination in young and older listeners with or without HI, although the musicians’ benefit decreased with increasing hearing loss. Additionally, models of the auditory periphery and midbrain were used to examine the effect of HI on F0 encoding. The model predictions reflected the worsening in F0 discrimination with increasing HI and accounted for up to 80 % of the variance in the data.

N2  - Background: Patients with Alzheimer's disease show impairment of cognitive processing including processing of musical stimuli. We aimed to evaluate whether the decline of musical processing already commences in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Methods: We enrolled 18 patients with MCI and without any other neurological or psychiatric disorder. We applied a self developed test of musical ability which evaluates the ability to identify melodies, pitch, rhythm, and emotional content of music. In addition, markers of dementia were measured in the cerebrospinal fluid. We compared the results of the patients to the results of age and sex matched healthy control subjects. All patients and subjects were without specific musical training. Results: Patients with MCI showed a significantly lower score in the rhythm, metrum, and emotion subtests and in the total test. The total test score was inversely correlated with the level of total tau in the cerebrospinal fluid. Conclusions: Our data suggest that some domains of musical ability are significantly impaired in patients with MCI. This does not necessarily mean that producing, enjoying, or listening to music is affected. However, it should be noted in the music therapy setting that processing of musical stimuli can be reduced in these patients.

N2  - Choir singing is a very popular activity with 4.5% of the European population regularly participating. London South Bank University was approached in January 2019 by St Paul's Cathedral to undertake noise dosimetry for the Music Department. Rehearsals and performances were identified and measured using acoustic instrumentation to determine if the choristers, adult choir, choir master or organist were compliant with the Control of Noise at Work Regulations 2005. These data were then matched to the daily and weekly work schedules of the musicians and the sound exposure estimated. The adult choir, organist and choir master were found to be under the set daily limits, 85 dBA (LEP,d). The most exposed chorister was above this limit. However, when adjusted for their shorter working year and using the weekly noise exposure limit of 87 dBA (LEP,w), the estimated exposure was compliant with the regulations. Recommendations were presented to the Music Department focusing on management techniques to reduce the weekly exposure of the choristers without effecting the spirit, tradition or musicality of the performance. It was also strongly suggested to reduce the number of performances for the boys by introducing a second choir.

N2  - Jegog is a traditional Balinese music from the region of Jembrana. It consists of several sets of instruments made of big size bamboo tubes. When being played together, the instrument produce high intensity noise. This study examine the effect of this noise to the risk of hearing loss among the players. This study was conducted in the village of Sangkaragung, Negara, Jembrana. This study used a cross sectional method, being conducted in May-June 2016. The target population is all players of Jegog. The reachable target is Jegog players in the village of Sangkaragung. The sample group is the Jegog Players, who are residents of the Sangkaragung village those have been exposed to the noise of Jegog. The control group is Sangkaragung villagers who are not Jegog players and those have not been exposed to the noise of Jegog. Samples were chosen by total random sampling, while controls were taken by simple random sampling according to predetermined inclusion and exclusion rules. Jegog produces noise in the range of 86 – 105 dB. The players have been exposed to the Jegog noise for an average of 2 hours per day or 10 hours per week. Among the 37 players in the sample group, there were 13 (35.1%) players found to have noise induced hearing loss seen in their audiogram. In the control group consisting of 37 villagers, there were only 2 (5,4%) persons found to have noise induced hearing loss. This resulted in a 7 adjusted prevalence ratio, which means that Jegog players have risk of having noise induced hearing loss 7 times higher than the control group. Statistic test gives a confidence interval 95%(1.6-31.1) with p= 0.011 (p<5). Statistically, there is a significant correlation between the noise of Jegog with the hearing loss among the players.

N2  - Professional musicians (PMs) are at high risk of developing hearing loss (HL) and other audiological symptoms such as tinnitus, hyperacusis, and diplacusis. The aim of this systematic review is to (A) assess the risk of developing HL and audiological symptoms in PMs and (B) evaluate if different music genres (Pop/Rock Music—PR; Classical Music—CL) expose PMs to different levels of risk of developing such conditions. Forty-one articles including 4618 PMs were included in the study. HL was found in 38.6% PMs; prevalence was significantly higher among PR (63.5%) than CL (32.8%) PMs; HL mainly affected the high frequencies in the 3000-6000 Hz range and was symmetric in 68% PR PMs and in 44.5% CL PMs. Tinnitus was the most common audiological symptom, followed by hyperacusis and diplacusis. Tinnitus was almost equally distributed between PR and CL PMs; diplacusis was more common in CL than in PR PMs, while prevalence of hyperacusis was higher among PR PMs. Our review showed that PR musicians have a higher risk of developing HL compared to CL PMs; exposure to sounds of high frequency and intensity and absence of ear protection may justify these results. Difference in HL symmetry could be explained by the type of instruments used and consequent single-sided exposure.

N2  - Aims: This study assessed the general health, music performance anxiety (MPA), and coping methods of musicians working in six state orchestras in Turkey. Methods: All musicians working in the state symphony orchestras (n=384) were invited to participate in the study. In face-to-face interviews, the authors administered a questionnaire, which consisted of five sections: sociodemographic information, history of musical performance, health status, general health questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12), and MPA scale. Mann-Whitney U-test, Student's t-test, and Spearman's correlation test were used to analyze the questionnaire data. Results: The 220 musicians who participated included 121 (55%) males and 99 (45%) females, with a mean age of 42.4±11.3 yrs. For musculoskeletal symptoms, 87.6% reported at least one symptom with the most common being pain. For general health status, the GHQ-12 showed 64% of musicians were at low risk, 18.7% at moderate risk, and 17.3% at high risk in terms of mental health. The prevalence of MPA before or during performance was 81.8%, and 60% of musicians stated that performance anxiety negatively affected their performances. Conclusions: Results indicate that musicians working in Turkish state symphony orchestras encounter numerous health problems (tinnitus, hearing loss, musculoskeletal symptoms, etc.) due to their profession. No specific health support is provided, especially education and health service provision.

N2  - Young musicians may be at risk for developing cochlear synaptopathy (CS), or hidden hearing loss (HHL), that could lead to permanent music-induced hearing loss (MIHL). Patients with CS often complain of tinnitus and/or difficulty understanding speech in noisy situations, even though traditional audiometric testing indicates normal hearing. The aim of this article was to determine the effects of including information about HHL on an Adopt-A-Band program involving college band members' concern about and self-efficacy toward the prevention of MIHL. We conducted a single-blinded, randomized clinical trial. Forty-eight band members participated in this study. Band members were randomly assigned to two Adopt-A-Band presentations, one with and one without information on HHL. Including information about HHL had no effect on these band members' concerns about and self-efficacy toward the prevention of MIHL. However, the Adopt-A-Band program resulted in significantly increased concern for MIHL by 39.5% (p < 0.0001, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 25-54.2), self-efficacy in its prevention by 79.1% (p < 0.0001, 95% CI: 66.9-91.2), and plans to use musicians' earplugs while playing by 67.4% (p < 0.0001, 95% CI: 53.4-81.45). Although inclusion of information about HHL did not have a significant effect, the Adopt-A-Band program, in general, significantly increased the immediate intent of these students to practice healthy hearing behaviors. Future research is needed to determine the long-term effects of using the Adopt-A-Band program with university marching bands' use of healthy hearing behaviors.

N2  - Background: Military musicians are working in a noisy environment with high sound exposure levels above the international standards. Aim of the current study is to find out, whether they develop the expected hearing impairments. Adherence to the regulations for prevention in musicians is more difficult than in other occupational fields. Methods: In an interval of 13.3 years, 36 out of 58 male military musicians of a German army music corps were subjected twice to an audiometric audit. There were no exclusion criteria apart from acute ENT infections (three musicians). These results were compared with one another and evaluated by means of statistical methods for relationships with several factors. Results: At frequencies below 3 kHz, the follow-up audiograms were up to 5 dB better than the preliminary examination. From 4 kHz up to 8 kHz the preliminary investigations showed less hearing impairment. Averaging all frequencies the improvement of hearing ability was around 1 dB. Above 1 kHz the average hearing of the right ear was up to 7 dB better than that of the left ear. Age-induced hearing loss was 3 to 8 dB lower than predicted by ISO standards over the entire frequency range. The side of the ear (right/left) and the frequency (3, 4, and 6 kHz) were significant (p < 0.05) in hearing loss, whereas the influence of the instrument and the acoustic traumata were not. Conclusion: Despite the high noise levels, the average hearing ability of the 36 military musicians during the investigation period only slightly deteriorated in the noise-sensitive frequencies (3, 5 and 6 kHz). Music may be less harmful than industrial noise, or the long-term auditory training of the musicians leads to a delayed presbycusis.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the contribution of all daily activities, including non-music activities, to the overall noise exposure of college student musicians, and to compare their "noise lives" with those of non-musician college students. DESIGN: Continuous week-long dosimetry measurements were collected on student musicians and non-musicians. During the measurement period, participants recorded their daily activities in journals. STUDY SAMPLE: 22 musicians and 40 non-musicians, all students (aged 18-24 years) at the University of Connecticut. RESULTS: On every day of the week, musicians experienced significantly higher average exposure levels than did non-musicians. Nearly half (47%) of the musicians' days exceeded a daily dose of 100%, compared with 10% of the non-musicians' days. When the exposure due to music activities was removed, musicians still led noisier lives, largely due to participation in noisier social activities. For some musicians, non-music activities contributed a larger share of their total weekly noise exposure than did their music activities. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with their non-musician peers, college student musicians are at higher risk for noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). On a weekly basis, non-music activities may pose a greater risk to some musicians than music activities. Thus, hearing health education for musicians should include information about the contribution of lifestyle factors outside of music to NIHL risk.

N2  - Music induced hearing loss (MIHL) is linked to chronic, extended exposure, and progress at a rate proportionate to exposure conditions. The aim was to document hearing deterioration; awareness of ear protection devices (EPDs); presence of tinnitus, measurement of temporary threshold shift. Thirty-four musicians filled a questionnaire regarding: years of experience, instrument/splayed, hours of music exposure per week with/with-out amplification, through earphones and speakers, use of EPDs and tinnitus. Hearing screening in five subjects was done before and after one hour and ten minutes of practice session. Among the participants, 8.8% reported hearing deterioration subjectively and 38.2% reported unilateral intermittent tinnitus, 79.4% lacked awareness about EPDs and 21.6 % were aware but never used them. Mean for temporary threshold shift at 500 Hz and 1 KHz was 5dB HL and 10dBHL at 2 KHz. Musicians are at risk for hearing problems, but the awareness on auditory damage is limited, hence conservative measures must be taken for their well being.

N2  - The effects of chronic exposure to high sound pressure levels (SPLs) are widely studied in the industry environment. However, the way that SPLs affect music students has not been thoroughly examined. In this paper, we study the SPL exposure of batucada students and we propose an assisted protection headphone as a part of e-health system. We measured the SPL reached during a regular percussion class. Pure-tone audiometries were performed to a set of percussion students. The gathered data were statistically analyzed. The assisted protection headphones and their operation are detailed and tested during a regular class. Our results show that 35% of the musicians present with a noise-induced hearing loss, considered as two frequencies with hearing loss of 25 dB or more or one frequency with a hearing loss of 30 dB or more. Our data also shows that those students that do not use any protection have a greater hearing loss. However, the students that use protection headphones are also suffering hearing loss. There might be a problem in the way that musicians are using the protection headphones. Our assisted protection headphones as a part of e-health measures can diminish the negative effects of percussion instruments for musicians.

N2  - Introduction: The vestibule is a rare localisation for schwannomas. We report a case of intravestibular schwannoma in a young patient. Case report: A 24 year-old male musician presented with left sensorineural hearing loss of 40 dB and fluctuating tinnitus. Temporal CT scan was normal but MRI with contrast revealed a 4-millimeter left intravestibular schwannoma. Although the patient did not complain of dizziness nor vertigo, vestibular examination revealed a left areflexia. Wait-and-scan attitude was recommended. 7 years later, the patient presented with left cophosis. MRI showed that the tumor volume had doubled. Surgical treatment was performed by translabyrinthine approach as the schwannoma extended to the lateral and superior semicircular canals. Discussion: There are only around 350 cases of intralabyrintine schwannomas described in the literature, among which 10% originate in the vestibule without extending to the cochlea. Clinical presentation may include sensorineural hearing loss, vertigo, tinnitus or a combination of these symptoms. In case of persistent or transient sudden hearing loss, MRI with contrast is the recommended first imaging study. Excision can be done either through the ear canal, even endoscopically, or by a translabyrinthine approach if there is an extension to the semicircular canals. Cochlear implants could be indicated. Conclusion: Surgical indication depends on the intensity of cochleovestibular symptoms and growing rate of the tumor, while surgical approach depends on tumor localisation.

N2  - Playing a musical instrument can affect physical and mental health. A literature review was conducted to determine the prevalence of health problems among oboists, which medical conditions can be caused or exacerbated by playing, whether oboe playing can be a protective factor, and whether recommendations are possible as to who should or should not play the oboe. Searches in 7 databases (Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, SocIndex, PsyIndex, Psychinfo) yielded a total of 950 studies; after exclusion of duplicates and those not meeting eligibility criteria, 37 articles were selected for final analysis. In addition, Google Scholar and a musicology library served as additional sources, revealing another 6 publications for inclusion. As a result, some evidence was found for musculoskeletal problems, focal dystonia, stress velopharyngeal incompetence, increased intraocular pressure and glaucoma, gastroesophageal reflux disease, lower pulmonary function, disease transmission via instruments, and hearing loss due to noise exposure. Playing the oboe may be protective against obstructive sleep apnea. However, due to small sample sizes, uncertain reproducibility of findings, and lack of accurate descriptions of problems reported by oboists, far more evidence would be necessary to answer the research questions conclusively. There was no evidence for causal relationships, and thus no recommendations can be made regarding who should (not) play the oboe. To improve the quality of medical care for these musicians and to implement prevention strategies, future investigations with more in-depth instrument-specific analyses and higher numbers of participants are needed.

N2  - Prior research using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) [1-4] and behavioral studies of patients with acquired or congenital amusia [5-8] suggest that the right posterior superior temporal gyrus (STG) in the human brain is specialized for aspects of music processing (for review, see [9-12]). Intracranial electrical brain stimulation in awake neurosurgery patients is a powerful means to determine the computations supported by specific brain regions and networks [13-21] because it provides reversible causal evidence with high spatial resolution (for review, see [22, 23]). Prior intracranial stimulation or cortical cooling studies have investigated musical abilities related to reading music scores [13, 14] and singing familiar songs [24, 25]. However, individuals with amusia (congenitally, or from a brain injury) have difficulty humming melodies but can be spared for singing familiar songs with familiar lyrics [26]. Here we report a detailed study of a musician with a low-grade tumor in the right temporal lobe. Functional MRI was used pre-operatively to localize music processing to the right STG, and the patient subsequently underwent awake intraoperative mapping using direct electrical stimulation during a melody repetition task. Stimulation of the right STG induced "music arrest" and errors in pitch but did not affect language processing. These findings provide causal evidence for the functional segregation of music and language processing in the human brain and confirm a specific role of the right STG in melody processing.

N2  - The ability to understand speech in the presence of competing sound sources is an important neuroscience question in terms of how the nervous system solves this computational problem. It is also a critical clinical problem that disproportionally affects the elderly, children with language-related learning disorders, and those with hearing loss. Recent evidence that musicians have an advantage on this multifaceted skill has led to the suggestion that musical training might be used to improve or delay the decline of speech-in-noise (SIN) function. However, enhancements have not been universally reported, nor have the relative contributions of different bottom-up versus top-down processes, and their relation to preexisting factors been disentangled. This information that would be helpful to establish whether there is a real effect of experience, what exactly is its nature, and how future training-based interventions might target the most relevant components of cognitive processes. These questions are complicated by important differences in study design and uneven coverage of neuroimaging modality. In this review, we aim to systematize recent results from studies that have specifically looked at musician-related differences in SIN by their study design properties, to summarize the findings, and to identify knowledge gaps for future work.

N2  - Objective: Workplace hazards in the performing arts cause injuries, disabilities, and deaths every year. Occupational health professionals are familiar with most of these hazards and are particularly qualified to contribute to efforts to reduce them. This article reviews current health issues in the performing arts and highlights opportunities for occupational health contributions. Methods: Recognized experts in performing arts medicine were consulted and articles illustrating performing arts health issues were reviewed. Literature sources included medical databases, unindexed art-health publications, and popular press articles. Results: Resources discussing hazards and health issues in theater, dance, voice, and instrumental musicians were located and reviewed. Conclusions: Treatment providers have a history of involvement with segments of the performing arts. The occupational health approach to workplace health issues can effectively complement these efforts. Sources of further information on performing arts health concerns are available.

N2  - Session Description: Approximately 1.1 billion young people are at risk of noise-induced hearing loss (HL), a major cause of preventable HL, because of unsafe listening practices by 40% to 50% of all people aged 12 to 35 years. HL prevalence among teenagers in the United States rose from 3.5% to 5.3% between 1994 and 2006. Worldwide, 16% of disabling HL in adults is attributed to occupational noise. Other noise-induced quality-of-life effects include hypertension, sleep disturbance, and cognitive impairment. “Temporary” tinnitus and threshold shift after noise exposure are not temporary. Histopathology shows noise causing immediate, irreversible synapse degeneration between hair cells and cochlear nerve terminals. Cochlear synaptopathy contributes to hearing-in-noise problems, tinnitus, and hyperacusis. This miniseminar will explore how society understands noise; how the musician community can be harnessed for prevention; the histopathology and clinical tests indicative of early noise-induced HL; how the ear, body, and brain react to noise; and what the otolaryngologist can do to intervene. Outcome Objectives: (1) Describe the current condition of noise pollution in the developing world. (2) Identify the relationship between noise exposure, hidden HL, and quality of life. (3) Examine the diagnostic difficulties in identifying cochlear synaptopathy and the tests that are more accurate.

N2  - Playing musical instruments can bring joy to people, but can also cause a wide variety of health issues that range from mild disorders to potentially fatal conditions. Although sports medicine is an established medical subspecialty, relatively few studies have investigated the health issues associated with musical instruments. Here we present an overview of these health issues. These include infections due to microorganisms, allergic reactions, as well as mechanical injuries from sustained high pressures within the oral, mediastinal, thoracic, and abdominal cavities. For example, wind instruments can potentially harbor thousands of pathogenic organisms. If several players share the same instrument, these instruments present potential hazards in the spread of infections. A fatal case of hypersensitivity pneumonitis in a bagpiper is particularly noteworthy. Similarly, a case of gastrointestinal anthrax in an animal-hide drummer is a reminder of this rare but highly fatal disease. Although not fatal, hearing-related disorders, neuromuscular issues, musculoskeletal problems, and contact dermatitis are also very common among instrumentalists. This review aims to illuminate these under-recognized health issues by highlighting both the common conditions and the rare but fatal cases.

N2  - Introduction: Loud music can cause hearing loss and symptoms such as tinnitus. That can lead to the end of a musician's professional career. Objective: To analyze the sound exposure and the auditory profile of musicians from a Military Police band. Methods: 34 musicians (31 men and three women) participated in the study, with an average age of 33.21; and an average time in the band of 7.38 years. Auditory symptoms and knowledge of hearing protection were ascertained. The sound pressure level was evaluated in five trials. Conventional threshold and high frequency tone audiometry were also performed. Results: The average sound pressure levels assessed during the five trials ranged from 93.2 to 98.5 dB LAeq for three hours of testing. Six musicians (17.64%) reported tinnitus, which was also reported as most frequent complaint after band practices (11.76%). Only one musician always used hearing protection and 10 musicians (29.41%) never wear hearing protection. Relative to the audiometric profile, eight (23.52%) musicians had thresholds higher than 25 dB HL in one or both ears. The worst average of tonal thresholds, even within normality, occurred at frequencies of 6000 Hz and 11,200 Hz, in both ears. Conclusion: The sound exposure of the musicians in a threehour practice exceeds the limits proposed in Brazilian Legislation. Thus, there is a negative impact on the hearing of its participants since audiological losses and presence of tinnitus were diagnosed.

N2  - Introduction: Sudden deafness is abrupt hearing loss, usually unilateral, with no well-defined etiological factor. The differential diagnosis includes some others diseases, such as infectious, hematological, neurological and most likely, the vestibular schawnnoma. Objectives: To report the therapeutic difficulties through a case of sudden deafness associated with dizziness and tinnitus. Resumed report: Patient 36 years old, 70 kg, male, musician. Admitted to an otorhinolaryngological unit complaining that 4 days after a concert woke up with accusation in the left ear, accompanied by rotatory dizziness worse to the movement of the head to the left, besides episodes of nausea and vomiting and non-pulsatile tinnitus in the left ear of the whistle type. Otoscopy and radiological exams without alterations, thus excluding the main differential diagnoses. Patient was hospitalized for initiation of drug therapy and audiometric screening. He has been using Ceftriaxone, Valacyclovir, Pentoxifylline, Ginkgo Biloba Extract and symptomatic remedies. Fifteen days after hospitalization there was a slight improvement in the audiometric standard and the clinical picture. Patient was discharged through a new evaluation of otolaryngology and phonoaudiology. There was a need to use a hearing aid for unilateral deafness and earplugs for work activities. Patient was followed up in an outpatient setting, with no further changes. Conclusion: The uncertainty of the etiopathogenesis and the great controversy over the treatment of the affected patients represent the difficult decision making through sudden deafness. Therefore, it is essential to stimulate further research in this area. deafness.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Musicians are at risk of hearing loss from sound exposure, and earplugs form part of many musicians' hearing conservation practices. Although musicians typically report a range of difficulties when wearing earplugs, there are many who have managed to successfully incorporate earplugs into their practice of music. OBJECTIVE: The study aim was to provide a detailed account of earplug usage from the perspective of the musician, including motivating factors, practical strategies, and attitudes. METHODS: In-depth interviews with 23 musicians were transcribed and content analysis was performed. Responses were coded and classified into three main themes: advantages, disadvantages, and usage patterns and strategies, together with an overlapping fourth theme, youth perspectives. RESULTS: Several positive aspects of wearing earplugs were identified, including long-term hearing protection and reduced levels of fatigue and pain. Musicians reported that earplugs present few problems for communication, improve sound clarity in ensembles, are discreet, and are easy to handle. However, earplugs also present challenges, including an overall dullness of sound, reduced immediacy, and an impaired ability to judge balance and intonation due to the occlusion effect, all of which influence usage habits and patterns. CONCLUSION: The experiences of the younger musicians and long-term users of earplugs indicate that practice, persistence, and a flexible approach are required for successful earplug usage. In time, there may be greater acceptance of earplugs, particularly amongst a new generation of musicians, some of whom regard the earplugs as a performance enhancement tool as well as a protective device.

N2  - Objective: To evaluate the determining factors of noise-induced sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) in professional musicians (PMs). Methods: An extensive review using Pubmed, Medscape and Google scholar research was performed and studies with the following keywords were selected: ‘hearing loss, tinnitus, hyperacusis, music, classical music, rock music, pop music, musicians, orchestra, music student, professional musician, non-professional musician, music exposure and temporary hearing loss’. A histopathology study from individuals who during life were musician in orchestra was described. Results: Eighty to ninety per cent of PMs are affected from noise-induced SNHL at 3000–8000 Hz frequencies. The range of the frequency of SNHL was correlated with the frequency of the specific frequency of the musical instrument and to the sound intensity which they were exposed. The two temporal bones studied, showed a severely loss hair cells at the basal turn of both cochleae and moderate loss of hair cells in medial and apical turn. Conclusion: The review and the results of the temporal bones (TBs) findings show that the intensity and frequency range are the more relevant factors causing noise-induced high frequency SNHL. The time exposed to sound, instead, can impact the low frequency range as supported by temporal bone results.

N2  - Auditioning is at the very center of educational and professional life in music and is associated with significant psychophysical demands. Knowledge of how these demands affect cardiovascular responses to psychosocial pressure is essential for developing strategies to both manage stress and understand optimal performance states. To this end, we recorded the electrocardiograms (ECGs) of 16 musicians (11 violinists and 5 flutists) before and during performances in both low- and high-stress conditions: with no audience and in front of an audition panel, respectively. The analysis consisted of the detection of R-peaks in the ECGs to extract heart rate variability (HRV) from the notoriously noisy real-world ECGs. Our data analysis approach spanned both standard (temporal and spectral) and advanced (structural complexity) techniques. The complexity science approachesDnamely, multiscale sample entropy and multiscale fuzzy entropyDindicated a statistically significant decrease in structural complexity in HRV from the low- to the high-stress condition and an increase in structural complexity from the pre-performance to performance period, thus confirming the complexity loss theory and a loss in degrees of freedom due to stress. Results from the spectral analyses also suggest that the stress responses in the female participants were more parasympathetically driven than those of the male participants. In conclusion, our findings suggest that interventions to manage stress are best targeted at the sensitive pre-performance period, before an audition begins.

N2  - Objective: Rock musicians are known to have an increased prevalence of hearing loss and tinnitus. The aims of the present study were to examine the distribution of anxiety and depression symptoms among rock musicians with or without tinnitus and how these mental health indicators and internal locus of control influenced upon their tinnitus symptom concerns and the degree to which the tinnitus affected their lives. Design: The study was a questionnaire-based cross-sectional survey of subjects selected from a cohort of rock musicians. We recruited 111 active musicians from the Oslo region, and a control group of 40 non-musicians from the student population at the University of Tromso. Results: Among the rock musicians 19.8% reported permanent tinnitus vs. 0% among the controls. Musicians more often reported anxiety symptoms than controls (35.1% vs. 17.5%), however this prevalence was not different in musicians with and without tinnitus. Tinnitus-affected musicians reported depressive symptoms, significantly more than controls (13.6% vs. 5%). Rock musicians consumed more alcohol than controls, but alcohol consumption was unrelated to severity of tinnitus. Drug abuse was not more prevalent in rock musicians than in controls. Duration of tinnitus, internal locus of control, sleep disturbance and anxiety were significant predictors of how affected and how concerned musicians were about their tinnitus. Conclusion: Rock musicians are at risk for the development of chronic tinnitus, and they have an increased prevalence of anxiety. There is an association between chronic tinnitus and depressive symptoms in rock musicians, but our results are ambiguous. Although rock musicians have a chronic exposure to noise, noise-induced hearing loss is not the sole causative agent for the development of tinnitus.

N2  - In the article the authors reveal the peculiarities of the influence of musical education of visually impaired children on their further socialization and integration into society. The authors present the data of an exceptional personality change as a result of obtaining musical education. Musical education has a positive impact, both on the personality of a blind musician, and on his ability to find a appropriate place in society. The development of musical abilities of blind schoolchildren occurs in complex conditions of lack of visual sensations. The impairment of visual perception impedes blind schoolchildren from studying musical works and scores independently. The success of further musical education of visually impaired children depends on the teachers’ typhlo-pedagogical knowledge. The success of rehabilitation and social adaptation of visually impaired musicians will largely depend on the special training of professionals that is music teachers.

N2  - Background: Musician's dystonia is a task-specific focal dystonia that can occur in any part of the body, most commonly on the face, neck muscles and upper limbs. Its frequency among the Brazilian population is unknown. This study aimed to assess the complaints of musicians with performance problems attributed to motor difficulties and to assess the frequency and clinical profile of musician's dystonia in Brazil. Methods: To identify individuals with dystonia, we visited orchestras and music schools in 19 Brazilian cities between March 2013 and March 2015, providing information about task-specific dystonia (TSD). Musicians were invited to answer a questionnaire, and those with possible neurological dysfunction were filmed while performing. In total, 2232 questionnaires were completed, with 72 subjects recorded on video in specific tasks and also were submitted the assessment of anxiety states and the severity of dystonia. Results: In total, 49 individuals were diagnosed with TSD (mean age 36.4 (±) 12.2 years; 92% male). The instruments most associated with TSD was the guitar acoustic (36.75%) and the brass instruments (30.6%). Conclusion: Our results suggest that the frequency of focal dystonia among musicians in Brazil is 2.2%, it can initially appear around 30 years old and is mostly associated with males, professional musicians who play classical concert music and in people who perform other activities using their upper limbs. Musculoskeletal injuries appear prior to the onset of dystonia. TSD is a condition that deserves further attention from musicians, teachers and health professionals.

N2  - Introduction: The effects caused by exposure to music are not always visible in the results of the tone audiometry. Evoked otoacoustic emissions can be used to search for indications of changes in the auditory system, including individuals with normal audiometric thresholds. Objective: To analyze the use of otoacoustic emissions evoked as a monitoring tool for hearing loss in young musicians. Method: The study was observational, cross-sectional of inquiry. The survey was conducted with 22 musicians of a Philharmonic band.Were conducted Anamnesis, Meatoscopy, acoustic immittance Measurements, tone Audiometry, Otoacoustic Emissions evoked by transient stimulus (TEOAE) and distortion product (DPOAE). Result: The study included 22 musicians with an average age of 17.41 years old (± 3.20), 72.73% were male and 27.27%, female. Regarding the results of transient otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE), were observed worse results in 4kHz among the acute frequencies. At this frequency, the left ear presented 13.64% of the missing answers. In the DPOAEs, the worst medians in f2 were observed in the frequencies of 3kHz and 8kHz. In the analyzes by ear of the TEOE, the absence of at least one of the frequency bandswas 9.09% on the RE and 18.18% in the LE. As for the DPOAE, the absence of at least one f2 was 27.27% in both ears. Conclusion: The otoacoustic emission test is useful in identifying evidences of changes resulting from continued exposure to amplified music.

N2  - Introduction: Music is considered a pleasant sound. However, when the exposure is continued and at high levels, it can have a negative effect on people's lives, especially musicians, professional category that is systematically exposed. Objective: To identify the auditory effects of music exposure in young musicians of a philharmonic band. Method: The study was observational and cross-sectional. The sample was conducted with 22 musicians of a philharmonic band of the city of Lagarto, Sergipe. The procedures include otoscopy, middle ear analysis, pure tone audiometry, Transient Evoked Otoacoustic Emission (TEOAE) and Distortion Product (DPOAE). Results: The study included 22 male musicians, aged from 13 to 24 years old. The most frequent auditory complaints were intolerance to loud sounds, communication difficulties and tinnitus. All the subjects presented auditory thresholds within normal patterns. However, were observed audiometric notches in both ears. In general, the TEOAE and DPOAEwere present; however, two musicians had an absence of TEOAE in the right ear in at least one of the frequency bands and, in the left ear, this fact occurred in four musicians. In the DPOAE, it was found an absence response in six musicians in, at least, one frequency in both ears. Conclusion: Despite the young sample and normal hearing thresholds, there was a high incidence of auditory complaints, changes of responses in otoacoustic emissions and audiometric notches; demonstrating the importance of research with musicians in this age group.

N2  - Introduction: Musicians are often exposed to high sound pressure levels during rehearsals and performances. Early detection of hearing loss is essential in this common people. Objectives: To investigate thresholds of pure tones of high frequency and amplitude of evoked otoacoustic emissions in music students. Methods: The sample was composed by 23 music students and 23 not musicians or music students (control group) and theywere matched for age and sex. High-frequency audiometry (9, 10, 11.2, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20 kHz), transient otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE) and distortion product (DPOAE) were performed. The data was processed by SPSS 21.0 software (Student Test or Mann-Whitney test). Results: Music students had lower pure tone thresholds at 9, 18 e 20 kHz (p value as 0.009; 0.05 e 0.001 respectively) and their TEOAE were lower in 2 and 4 kHz frequencies as in 3kHz frequency in DPOAE, once compared with control group (p < 0.005). Conclusion: Music students have a special skill to detect pure tones of high frequencies (9, 18 and 20 kHz); however, the outer hair cells had reduced range in otoacoustic emissions, so the EOA exam is an important tool to follow up this population to prevent hearing loss.

N2  - Aim: Gamelan comprises percussion instruments from Indonesia. Its communal, egalitarian approach to music-making and the accessibility of the instruments has resulted in its use in inclusive arts and education programmes outside Indonesia. This study explored the impact on interaction and well-being of Gamelan sessions for students with profound and complex needs including hearing loss. Method: 13 students aged 5 to 15 years took part in weekly, 45-minute sessions throughout the school year, each supported by one or two support workers. Sessions were led by three musicians. Data collection included video-recordings, field notes and staff interviews. Results: Videoobservations demonstrate increases in engagement, vocalisation, and movements in synchrony. Students reportedly accepted hearing aids more readily and wore them for longer periods in sessions. Students demonstrated increased awareness of, receptivity to, and initiation of musical conversations and musicmaking more generally. Staff reported gains in their own knowledge. Training was highly rated at 9/10 (n=23 staff). Conclusions: This exploratory study suggests that collective music-making can enhance interaction and well-being in students with complex needs. More systematic evaluation is on-going. Practice implications will be presented.

N2  - The mammalian cochlea functions as a filter bank that performs a spectral, Fourier-like decomposition on the acoustic signal. While tuning can be compromised (e.g., broadened with hearing impairment), whether or not human cochlear frequency resolution can be sharpened through experiential factors (e.g., training or learning) has not yet been established. Previous studies have demonstrated sharper psychophysical tuning curves in trained musicians compared to nonmusicians, implying superior peripheral tuning. However, these findings are based on perceptual masking paradigms, and reflect engagement of the entire auditory system rather than cochlear tuning, per se. Here, by directly mapping physiological tuning curves from stimulus frequency otoacoustic emissions (SFOAEs)-cochlear emitted sounds-we show that estimates of human cochlear tuning in a high-frequency cochlear region (4 kHz) is further sharpened (by a factor of 1.5×) in musicians and improves with the number of years of their auditory training. These findings were corroborated by measurements of psychophysical tuning curves (PTCs) derived via simultaneous masking, which similarly showed sharper tuning in musicians. Comparisons between SFOAE and PTCs revealed closer correspondence between physiological and behavioral curves in musicians, indicating that tuning is also more consistent between different levels of auditory processing in trained ears. Our findings demonstrate an experience-dependent enhancement in the resolving power of the cochlear sensory epithelium and the spectral resolution of human hearing and provide a peripheral account for the auditory perceptual benefits observed in musicians. Both local and feedback (e.g., medial olivocochlear efferent) mechanisms are discussed as potential mechanisms for experience-dependent tuning.

N2  - Background: Musicians outperform nonmusicians on brainstem and cortical level processing. However, there are limited literature comparing musicians and nonmusicians on the overall release of masking abilities and correlation across otoacoustic emissions (OAEs), masking level difference (MLD) and quick speech-in-noise (Quick-SIN). Aim: To investigate the physiological differences between musicians and nonmusicians by evaluating the effect of musical training on contralateral suppression (CAS) of OAE, MLD, and Quick-SIN. Materials and Methods: Distortion product OAEs (DPOAEs) recording with and without noise, MLD test using continuous (CMLD) and pulsating pure tones (PMLD) and Quick-SIN in Kannada were carried out on 15 musicians and 15 nonmusicians. Results: Musicians outperformed nonmusicians on Quick-SIN and CAS of OAEs. However, no significant difference was observed between two groups on CMLD and PMLD. There was a significant difference observed in CMLD, PMLD as well as suppression amplitude across frequencies tested in both groups. A significant difference between PMLD and CMLD was observed only for musicians at 2 kHz. In both groups, there was a significant level of correlation for CAS of DPOAE and Quick-SIN with CMLD and with PMLD between the parameters tested. Conclusion: The results of our finding suggest that CAS of DPOAE and Quick-SIN are sensitive tools to quantify the effect of musical training, compared to MLD. Musical training helps to strengthen afferent and efferent pathways, and hence it aids in speech perception abilities in noise. Hence, for the intervention of individuals with difficulties in speech perception in noise, musical training can be a choice to be considered. As well for appropriate diagnosis and interpretation, one needs to consider the musical experience of individual tested.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: College musicians exhibit greater declines in hearing than the general population and are at particular risk because they rehearse and perform daily in loud environments. Also, they engage in use of personal listening devices which increases the amount of "exposure" time. Despite increased risk, many do not use hearing protection devices (HPD). The purpose of this study was to (1) to identify the present level of education about hearing health, (2) identify the perceived advantages and disadvantages of using HPD, and (3) evaluate results among different musical instrument groups. METHODS: A mixedmethods group design was used including both quantitative and qualitative instruments. SPSS was used to generate descriptive statistics, and non-parametric statistical analysis was performed on quantitative data. NVivo software was used to evaluate qualitative responses. RESULTS: Of the 90 college instrumental music students who participated, 12% reported a history of hearing loss, and over one-third reported tinnitus. Seventy-seven percent of participants had never received any training about hearing health and only a small percentage of students used HPD. The most cited reason for lack of protection use was its negative impact on sound quality. However, group differences were noted between brass, woodwind, and percussion musicians in terms of HPD uptake. CONCLUSION: Improving the type of information disseminated to college musicians may reduce the risk of ear-related deficits. Noise dosage information, HPD information, and prevention education grounded in theories like the Health Belief Model may increase awareness and promote greater use of HPDs in this population.

N2  - Previous studies have indicated that extended exposure to a high level of sound might increase the risk of hearing loss among professional symphony orchestra musicians. One of the major problems associated with musicians' hearing loss is difficulty in estimating its risk simply on the basis of the physical amount of exposure, i.e. the exposure level and duration. The aim of this study was to examine whether the measurement of the medial olivocochlear reflex (MOCR), which is assumed to protect the cochlear from acoustic damage, could enable us to assess the risk of hearing loss among musicians. To test this, we compared the MOCR strength and the hearing deterioration caused by one-hour instrument practice. The participants in the study were music university students who are majoring in the violin, whose left ear is exposed to intense violin sounds (broadband sounds containing a significant number of high-frequency components) during their regular instrument practice. Audiogram and click-evoked otoacoustic emissions (CEOAEs) were measured before and after a one-hour violin practice. There was a larger exposure to the left ear than to the right ear, and we observed a left-ear specific temporary threshold shift (TTS) after the violin practice. Left-ear CEOAEs decreased proportionally to the TTS. The exposure level, however, could not entirely explain the inter-individual variation in the TTS and the decrease in CEOAE. On the other hand, the MOCR strength could predict the size of the TTS and CEOAE decrease. Our findings imply that, among other factors, the MOCR is a promising measure for assessing the risk of hearing loss among musicians.

N2  - Introduction: Tinnitus is one of the most reported auditory symptoms among musicians and can negatively influence their ability to work, sometimes even more severely than hearing loss. Objectives: To analyze the occurrence of tinnitus and other auditory symptoms in musicians who play different instruments. Methods: One hundred musicians participated by answering a questionnaire on instrument played, practice time with the instrument, occurrence of tinnitus, hearing difficulties, and intolerance to loud sounds. The symptoms were analyzed in relation to gender, musical instrument, and time of experience using statistical tests such as the Chi-squared test and Difference in Proportions test at a significance level of 0.05 as well as finding the Prevalence Ratio. Results: Tinnitus was the most frequent symptom among musicians, especially among those who play amplified instruments. There was an association between tinnitus and hearing difficulty, and between instrument experience time and intolerance to loud sounds. The proportion of musicians with occasional tinnitus was high among those with less than 15 years of musical practice, and 4.53 times more prevalent in those with more than 15 years of experience. Conclusion: The presence of auditory symptoms, especially tinnitus, among musicians reinforces the need for implementation of hearing conservation programs for this profession.

N2  - Finger injuries are common and can greatly affect a musician’s quality of life. A 55-year-old man, who had injured the proximal interphalangeal joint of the left index finger 6 months prior to any intervention, was treated with a manual therapy approach incorporating instrument-assisted soft tissue mobilization (IASTM). Initial examination findings included self-reported pain and functional limitations and physical impairments that significantly impeded his ability to play the acoustic guitar. He was treated once a week for 6 weeks with IASTM, joint mobilization, therapeutic exercise, and ice massage. Additionally, a home exercise program and self-care instructions were provided. The patient gained positive outcomes with improvements in pain (Numerical Pain Rating Scale while playing the guitar: initial 5/10, discharge 1/10) and function (Disability Arm Shoulder Hand Sports-Performing Arts Optional Module: initial 75; discharge 6.25), each reaching a minimum clinically important difference. Importantly, he was able to play the guitar with minimal to no pain as desired. Physical measures also improved, including an immediate gain in finger range of motion with IASTM alone. Manual therapy approaches integrating IASTM may provide an effective conservative treatment strategy for patients with finger/hand conditions in the performing arts and other patient populations.

N2  - Epidemiological studies among performing artists have found elevated stress levels and health effects, but scarcely the full range of stressors has been reported. We review here the existing literature on job-related stressors of classical instrumental musicians (orchestra musicians). PubMed, Google Scholar and JSTOR databases were screened for relevant papers indexed up to August 2012. A total of 122 papers was initially identified which, after exclusion of duplicates and those not meeting eligibility criteria, yielded 67 articles for final analysis. We identified seven categories of stressors affecting musicians in their everyday working lives: public exposure, personal hazards, repertoire, competition, job context, injury/illness, and criticism, but with interrelated assigned factors. The proposed categories provide a framework for future comprehensive research on the impact and management of musician stressors.

N2  - Ludwig van Beethoven is nowadays considered to be one of the greatest composers in the history of music and his myth-like reputation is enhanced by his deafness; however, deafness was not the only condition which affected his genius. Due to the many lamentations contained in his letters about continuously recurring health problems, various attempts at an interpretation of Beethoven’s personality have been undertaken. These included psychoanalytical considerations with respect to his father-mother relationship and also diagnostic attempts with reference to the symptoms of a possible borderline personality syndrome. The aim of this article is to comprehensively analyze the diseases of the patient Beethoven from the perspective of specialized medical disciplines based on new research results, to summarize various discipline-specific considerations and to make a contemporary assessment from the viewpoint of current scientific results.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to investigate the extent to which cochlear implant (CI) users rely on tempo and mode in perception of musical emotion when compared with normal hearing (NH) individuals.
METHODS: A test battery of novel four-bar melodies was created and adapted to four permutations with alterations of tonality (major vs. minor) and tempo (presto vs. largo), resulting in non-ambiguous (major key/fast tempo and minor key/slow tempo) and ambiguous (major key/slow tempo, and minor key/fast tempo) musical stimuli. Both CI and NH participants listened to each clip and provided emotional ratings on a Likert scale of +5 (happy) to -5 (sad).
RESULTS: A three-way ANOVA demonstrated an overall effect for tempo in both groups, and an overall effect for mode in the NH group. The CI group rated stimuli of the same tempo similarly, regardless of changes in mode, whereas the NH group did not. A subgroup analysis indicated the same effects in both musician and non-musician CI users and NH listeners.
DISCUSSION: The results suggest that the CI group relied more heavily on tempo than mode in making musical emotion decisions. The subgroup analysis further suggests that level of musical training did not significantly impact this finding.
CONCLUSION: CI users weigh temporal cues more heavily than pitch cues in inferring musical emotion. These findings highlight the significant disadvantage of CI users in comparison with NH listeners for music perception, particularly during recognition of musical emotion, a critically important feature of music.

N2  - Background Impairments of timing abilities are characteristic of different neurological and psychiatric disorders such as Parkinson's disease, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or schizophrenia. They can also occur in healthy individuals suffering from beat deaf deafness. These deficits are expressed in the form of impoverished timed performance and/or poor time perception. The characterization of the timing skills of these impaired populations is valuable for the understanding of the disorders and can pave the way to targeted rehabilitation perspectives. To date, no exhaustive tools are available for the systematic assessment of timing skills. Objective We aim to introduce the Battery for the Assessment of Auditory Sensorimotor and Timing Abilities (BAASTA), a new tool for the sytematic assessment of rhythm perception and auditorymotor synchronization skills. Preliminary results in Parkinson's disease, ADHD as well as in the general population are presented. Material and method The battery includes a large array of perceptual and sensorimotor tasks. Perceptual tasks include the comparision of two durations, the discrimination between regular and irregular metronome or musical sequences and judging if a tone is aligned with the beat of music. Sensorimotor tasks include unpaced tapping and paced tapping with metronome and music. Results The BAASTA highlighted improvements in timing abilities after a musically cued gait training in patients with Parkinson's disease. The battery also described the timing impairments in ADHD. Furthermore, the BAASTA helped to characterize individual differences in the general population (e.g. musicians vs. nonmusicians). Discussion BAASTA is sensitive for the characterization of individual differences within a population in terms of sensorimotor and perceptual timing skills. Given the existing links between timing skills, motor control and cognition, its use could help develop an individualized approach to rehabilitation of motor abilities and cognition in a variety of disorders.

N2  - Congenital amusia is a neurogenetic condition, characterized by a deficit in music perception and production, not explained by hearing loss, brain damage or lack of exposure to music. Despite inferior musical performance, amusics exhibit normal auditory cortical responses, with abnormal neural correlates suggested to lie beyond auditory cortices. Here we show, using auditory brainstem responses to complex sounds in humans, that fine-grained automatic processing of sounds is impoverished in amusia. Compared with matched non-musician controls, spectral amplitude was decreased in amusics for higher harmonic components of the auditory brainstem response. We also found a delayed response to the early transient aspects of the auditory stimulus in amusics. Neural measures of spectral amplitude and response timing correlated with participants' behavioral assessments of music processing. We demonstrate, for the first time, that amusia affects how complex acoustic signals are processed in the auditory brainstem. This neural signature of amusia mirrors what is observed in musicians, such that the aspects of the auditory brainstem responses that are enhanced in musicians are degraded in amusics. By showing that gradients of music abilities are reflected in the auditory brainstem, our findings have implications not only for current models of amusia but also for auditory functioning in general.

N2  - Recreational music exposure is a potential risk factor for noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). Augmented hearing protectors have been designed with modified attenuation characteristics to combine hearing protection and listening comfort. However, to date, only a few independent studies have assessed the performance of those augmented protectors in realistic exposure conditions. This study compares the listening experience and temporary effects on cochlear status with different types of earplugs after exposure to contemporary club music. Five different types of commercially available hearing protectors were worn, all commonly used during leisure-time music exposure. Four of them were augmented premolded earplugs and the fifth type was an inexpensive, standard earplug frequently distributed for free at music events. During five different test sessions of 30 min each, participants not professionally involved in music wore one particular type of protector. Contemporary club music was played at sound pressure levels (SPLs) representative of concerts and bars. After each listening session, a questionnaire on sound quality and general appreciation was completed. In addition, otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) were measured directly before and after music exposure. The reported appreciation clearly differed depending on the addressed characteristics and the specific earplug type. In this test group, the reported appreciation mainly depended on comfort and looks, while differences in sound quality were less noticeable. The changes in OAE amplitude before and after noise exposure were small in terms of clinical standards. Nevertheless, the observed temporary shifts differed systematically for the different types of hearing protectors, with two types of musician earplug showing a more systematic decline than the others. Further research with respect to actual use and achieved protection for real, unsupervised music exposure is warranted.

N2  - Noise exposure is a known occupational health hazard to those serving in the military. Previous military epidemiology studies have identified military occupations at risk of noise induced hearing loss (NIHL); however, musicians have not been specifically mentioned. The focus of military NIHL studies is usually on those service members of the combat arms occupations. This project was a preliminary examination of Department of Defense (DoD) active duty military musicians in regard to their noise exposure, annual hearing test rates, and hearing injury rates using available data sources. The analysis concluded that DoD military musicians are an underserved population in terms of hearing conservation efforts. Noise surveillance data extracted from the Defense Occupational and Environmental Health Readiness System-Industrial Hygiene showed that every musician similar exposure group (SEG) with noise survey data from 2009 to 2013 exceeded the occupation exposure level adopted by DoD Instruction 6055.12. However, only a small percentage of all DoD active duty military musicians (5.5% in the peak year of 2012) were assigned to a SEG that was actually surveyed. Hearing test data based on Current Procedural Terminology coding extracted from the Military Health System revealed that the percentage of musicians with annual hearing tests increased over the 5 years studied in all services except the Air Force. During 2013, the data showed that the Navy had the highest percentage of musicians with annual hearing tests at 70.9%, and the Air Force had the lowest at 11.4%. The Air Force had the highest percentage of hearing injuries of those musicians with annual hearing tests for all 5 years analyzed. Although noise surveillance and annual hearing tests are being conducted, they occur at a much lower rate than required for a population that is known to be overexposed to noise.

N2  - Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) has been extensively studied in industrial work environments. With the advent of new technologies, loud music has been increasingly affecting listeners outside of the industrial setting. Most research on the effects of music and hearing loss has focused on classical musicians. The purpose of the current study was to examine the relationship between the amount of experience a professional pop/rock/jazz musician has and objective and subjective variables of the musician's hearing loss. This study also examined professional pop/rock/jazz musicians' use of hearing protection devices in relation to the extent of their exposure to amplified music. Forty-four pop/rock/jazz musicians were interviewed using the Pop/Rock/Jazz Musician's Questionnaire (PRJMQ) in order to obtain self-reported symptoms of tinnitus and hyperacusis. Forty-two of the subjects were also tested for air-conduction hearing thresholds in the frequency range of 1-8 kHz. Results show that the extent of professional pop/rock/jazz musicians' exposure to amplified music was related to both objective and subjective variables of hearing loss: Greater musical experience was positively linked to higher hearing thresholds in the frequency range of 3-6 kHz and to the subjective symptom of tinnitus. Weekly hours playing were found to have a greater effect on hearing loss in comparison to years playing. Use of hearing protection was not linked to the extent of exposure to amplified music. It is recommended that further research be conducted with a larger sample, in order to gain a greater understanding of the detrimental effects of hours playing versus years playing.

N2  - The association between music and epileptic seizures is complex and intriguing. Musical processing within the human brain recruits a network which involves many cortical areas that could activate as part of a temporal lobe seizure or become hyperexcitable on musical exposure as in the case of musicogenic epilepsy. The dichotomous effect of music on seizures may be explained by modification of dopaminergic circuitry or counteractive cognitive and sensory input in ictogenesis. Research has explored the utility of music as a therapy in epilepsy and while limited studies show some evidence of an effect on seizure activity; further work is required to ascertain its clinical potential. Sodium channel-blocking antiepileptic drugs, e.g., carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine, appear to effect pitch perception particularly in native-born Japanese, a rare but important adverse effect, particularly if a professional musician. Temporal lobe surgery for right lateralizing epilepsy has the capacity to effect all facets of musical processing, although risk and correlation to resection area need further research. There is a need for the development of investigative tools of musical processing that could be utilized along the surgical pathway. Similarly, work is also required in devising a musical paradigm as part of electroencephalography to improve surveillance of musicogenic seizures. These clinical applications could aid the management of epilepsy and preservation of musical ability.

N2  - It is well recognized that professional musicians are at risk of hearing damage due to the exposure to high sound pressure levels during music playing. However, it is important to recognize that the musicians exposure may start early in the course of their training as students in the classroom and at home. Studies regarding sound exposure of music students and their hearing disorders are scarce and do not take into account important influencing variables. Therefore, this study aimed to describe sound level exposures of music students at different music styles, classes, and according to the instrument played. Further, this investigation attempted to analyze the perceptions of students in relation to exposure to loud music and consequent health risks, as well as to characterize preventive behaviors. The results showed that music students are exposed to high sound levels in the course of their academic activity. This exposure is potentiated by practice outside the school and other external activities. Differences were found between music style, instruments, and classes. Tinnitus, hyperacusis, diplacusis, and sound distortion were reported by the students. However, students were not entirely aware of the health risks related to exposure to high sound pressure levels. These findings reflect the importance of starting intervention in relation to noise risk reduction at an early stage, when musicians are commencing their activity as students.

N2  - This paper reviews music research using Mismatch Negativity (MMN). MMN is a deviation-specific component of auditory event-related potential (EPR), which detects a deviation between a sound and an internal representation (e.g., memory trace). Recent studies have expanded the notion and the paradigms of MMN to higher-order music processing such as those involving short melodies, harmony chord, and music syntax. In this vein, we firstly reviewed the evolution of MMN from sound to music and then mainly compared the differences of MMN features between musicians and nonmusicians, followed by the discussion of the potential roles of the training effect and the natural exposure in MMN. Since MMN can serve as an index of neural plasticity, it thus can be widely used in clinical and other applied areas, such as detecting music preference in newborns or assessing wholeness of central auditory system of hearing illness. Finally, we pointed out some open questions and further directions. Current music perception research using MMN has mainly focused on relatively low hierarchical structure of music perception. To fully understand the neural substrates underlying processing of regularities in music, it is important and beneficial to combine MMN with other experimental paradigms such as early right-anterior negativity (ERAN).

N2  - Musical training during childhood has been linked to more robust encoding of sound later in life. We take this as evidence for an auditory reserve: a mechanism by which individuals capitalize on earlier life experiences to promote auditory processing. We assert that early auditory experiences guide how the reserve develops and is maintained over the lifetime. Experiences that occur after childhood, or which are limited in nature, are theorized to affect the reserve, although their influence on sensory processing may be less long-lasting and may potentially fade over time if not repeated. This auditory reserve may help to explain individual differences in how individuals cope with auditory impoverishment or loss of sensorineural function.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Research has shown that hearing loss in musicians may cause difficulty in timbre recognition and tuning of instruments.
AIM: To analyze the hearing thresholds from 250 Hz to 16,000 Hz in a group of music students and compare them to a non-musician group in order to determine whether high-frequency audiometry is a useful tool in the early detection of hearing impairment.
METHODS: Study design was a retrospective observational cohort. Conventional and high-frequency audiometry was performed in 42 music students (Madsen Itera II audiometer and TDH39P headphones for conventional audiometry, and HDA 200 headphones for high-frequency audiometry).
RESULTS: Of the 42 students, 38.1% were female students and 61.9% were male students, with a mean age of 26 years. At conventional audiometry, 92.85% had hearing thresholds within normal limits; but even within the normal limits, the worst results were observed in the left ear for all frequencies, except for 4000 Hz; compared to the non-musician group, the worst results occurred at 500 Hz in the left ear, and at 250 Hz, 6000 Hz, 9000 Hz, 10,000 Hz, and 11,200 Hz in both the ears.
CONCLUSION: The periodic evaluation of high-frequency thresholds may be useful in the early detection of hearing loss in musicians.

N2  - In this review article, we focus on recent studies of experiential influences on brainstem function. Using these studies as scaffolding, we then lay the initial groundwork for the Layering Hypothesis, which explicates how experiences combine to shape subcortical auditory function. Our hypothesis builds on the idea that the subcortical auditory system reflects the collective auditory experiences of an individual, including interactions with sound that occurred in the distant past. Our goal for this article is to begin to shift the field away from examining the effect of single experiences to examining how different auditory experiences layer or superimpose on each other. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled <Annual Reviews 2014>.

N2  - Modern cochlear implant (CI) users understand speech but find difficulty in music appreciation due to poor pitch perception. Still, some deaf musicians continue to perform with their CI. Here we show unexpected results that CI musicians can reliably tune a guitar by CI alone and, under controlled conditions, match simultaneously presented tones to <0.5 Hz. One subject had normal contralateral hearing and produced more accurate tuning with CI than his normal ear. To understand these counterintuitive findings, we presented tones sequentially and found that tuning error was larger at ∼30 Hz for both subjects. A third subject, a non-musician CI user with normal contralateral hearing, showed similar trends in performance between CI and normal hearing ears but with less precision. This difference, along with electric analysis, showed that accurate tuning was achieved by listening to beats rather than discriminating pitch, effectively turning a spectral task into a temporal discrimination task.

N2  - Musical training and experience greatly enhance the cortical and subcortical processing of sounds, which may translate to superior auditory perceptual acuity. Auditory temporal resolution is a fundamental perceptual aspect that is critical for speech understanding in noise in listeners with normal hearing, auditory disorders, cochlear implants, and language disorders, yet very few studies have focused on music-induced learning of temporal resolution. This report demonstrates that Carnatic musical training and experience have a significant impact on temporal resolution assayed by gap detection thresholds. This experience-dependent learning in Carnatic-trained musicians exhibits the universal aspects of human perception and plasticity. The present work adds the perceptual component to a growing body of neurophysiological and imaging studies that suggest plasticity of the peripheral auditory system at the level of the brainstem. The present work may be intriguing to researchers and clinicians alike interested in devising cross-cultural training regimens to alleviate listening-in-noise difficulties.© 2014 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

N2  - For musicians, the impact of noise exposure is not yet fully characterized. Some inconsistencies can be found in the methodology used to evaluate noise exposure. This study aims to analyze the noise exposure of musicians in a symphonic orchestra to understand their risk for hearing loss, applying the methodology proposed by ISO 9612:2009. Noise levels were monitored among musicians during the rehearsal of eight different repertoires. Test subjects were selected according to their instrument and position in the orchestra. Participants wore noise dosimeters throughout the rehearsals. A sound meter was used to analyze the exposure of the conductor. The results showed that musicians are exposed to high noise levels that can damage hearing. Brass, woodwind and percussion and timpani musicians were exposed to noise levels in excess of the upper exposure action level of 85 dB (A), while the other instrumental groups had a lower exposure action level of 80 dB (A). Percussion musicians were exposed to high peak noise levels of 135 dB (C). Sound levels varied by instrument, repertoire and position. Octave frequency analyses showed differences among musicians. This study suggests that musicians are at risk for hearing loss. There is a need for more effective guidelines applicable to all countries, which should define standardized procedures for determining musician noise exposure and should allow exposure level normalization to the year, including different repertoires.

N2  - The core cognitive difficulty in developmental dyslexia involves phonological processing, but adults and children with dyslexia also have sensory impairments. Impairments in basic auditory processing show particular links with phonological impairments, and recent studies with dyslexic children across languages reveal a relationship between auditory temporal processing and sensitivity to rhythmic timing and speech rhythm. As rhythm is explicit in music, musical training might have a beneficial effect on the auditory perception of acoustic cues to rhythm in dyslexia. Here we took advantage of the presence of musicians with and without dyslexia in musical conservatoires, comparing their auditory temporal processing abilities with those of dyslexic non-musicians matched for cognitive ability. Musicians with dyslexia showed equivalent auditory sensitivity to musicians without dyslexia and also showed equivalent rhythm perception. The data support the view that extensive rhythmic experience initiated during childhood (here in the form of music training) can affect basic auditory processing skills which are found to be deficient in individuals with dyslexia.

N2  - Cochlear implants (CIs) are auditory prostheses that restore hearing via electrical stimulation of the auditory nerve. Compared to normal acoustic hearing, sounds transmitted through the CI are spectro-temporally degraded, causing difficulties in challenging listening tasks such as speech intelligibility in noise and perception of music. In normal hearing (NH), musicians have been shown to better perform than non-musicians in auditory processing and perception, especially for challenging listening tasks. This "musician effect" was attributed to better processing of pitch cues, as well as better overall auditory cognitive functioning in musicians. Does the musician effect persist when pitch cues are degraded, as it would be in signals transmitted through a CI? To answer this question, NH musicians and non-musicians were tested while listening to unprocessed signals or to signals processed by an acoustic CI simulation. The task increasingly depended on pitch perception: (1) speech intelligibility (words and sentences) in quiet or in noise, (2) vocal emotion identification, and (3) melodic contour identification (MCI). For speech perception, there was no musician effect with the unprocessed stimuli, and a small musician effect only for word identification in one noise condition, in the CI simulation. For emotion identification, there was a small musician effect for both. For MCI, there was a large musician effect for both. Overall, the effect was stronger as the importance of pitch in the listening task increased. This suggests that the musician effect may be more rooted in pitch perception, rather than in a global advantage in cognitive processing (in which musicians would have performed better in all tasks). The results further suggest that musical training before (and possibly after) implantation might offer some advantage in pitch processing that could partially benefit speech perception, and more strongly emotion and music perception © 2014 Fuller, Galvin, Maat, Free and Baskent.

N2  - The outer hair cells of the organ of Corti are the target of abundant efferent projections from the olivocochlear system. This peripheral efferent auditory subsystem is currently thought to be modulated by central activity via corticofugal descending auditory system, and to modulate active cochlear micromechanics. Although the function of this efferent subsystem remains unclear, physiological, psychophysical, and modeling data suggest that it may be involved in ear protection against noise damage and auditory perception, especially in the presence of background noise. Moreover, there is mounting evidence that its activity is modulated by auditory and visual attention. A commonly used approach to measure olivocochlear activity noninvasively in humans relies on the suppression of otoacoustic emissions by contralateral noise. Previous studies have found substantial interindividual variability in this effect, and statistical differences have been observed between professional musicians and non-musicians, with stronger bilateral suppression effects in the former. In this paper, we review these studies and discuss various possible interpretations for these findings, including experience-dependent neuroplasticity. We ask whether differences in olivocochlear function between musicians and non-musicians reflect differences in peripheral auditory function or in more central factors, such as top-down attentional modulation. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Experience-dependent characteristics of auditory function, especially with regard to speech-evoked auditory neurophysiology, have garnered increasing attention in recent years. This interest stems from both pragmatic and theoretical concerns as it bears implications for the prevention and remediation of language-based learning impairment in addition to providing insight into mechanisms engendering experience-dependent changes in human sensory function. Musicians provide an attractive model for studying the experience-dependency of auditory processing in humans due to their distinctive neural enhancements compared to nonmusicians. We have only recently begun to address whether these enhancements are observable early in life, during the initial years of music training when the auditory system is under rapid development, as well as later in life, after the onset of the aging process. Here we review neural enhancements in musically trained individuals across the life span in the context of cellular mechanisms that underlie learning, identified in animal models. Musicians' subcortical physiologic enhancements are interpreted according to a cognitive framework for auditory learning, providing a model in which to study mechanisms of experience-dependent changes in human auditory function. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Background: Hearing disorders have been associated with occupational exposure to music. Musicians may benefit from non-amplified and low-intensity music, but may also have high risks of music-induced hearing loss. Aims: To compare the incidence of hearing loss (HL) and its subentities in professional musicians with that in the general population. Methods: We performed a historical cohort study among insurants between 19 and 66 years who were employed subject to social insurance contributions. The study was conducted with data from three German statutory health insurance providers covering the years 2004-2008 with about 7 million insurants. Incidence rates with 95% CIs of HL and the subentities noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL), conductive HL, sensorineural HL, conductive and sensorineural HL, as well as tinnitus were estimated stratified by age, sex and federal state. A Cox regression analysis was conducted to estimate adjusted HRs and two-sided 95% CIs for HL and its subentities. Results: More than 3 million insurants were eligible, of whom 2227 were identi fi ed as professional musicians (0.07%). During the 4-year observation period, 283 697cases of HL were seen, 238 of them among professional musicians (0.08%), leading to an unadjusted incidence rate ratio of 1.27. The adjusted hazard ratio of musicians was 1.45 (95% CI 1.28 to 1.65) for HL and 3.61 (95% CI 1.81 to 7.20) for NIHL. Conclusions: Professional musicians have a high risk of contracting hearing disorders. Use of already available prevention measures should reduce the incidence of HL in professional musicians.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Research has shown that hearing loss in musicians may cause difficulty in timbre recognition and tuning of instruments.
AIM: To analyze the hearing thresholds from 250 Hz to 16,000 Hz in a group of music students and compare them to a non-musician group in order to determine whether high-frequency audiometry is a useful tool in the early detection of hearing impairment.
METHODS: Study design was a retrospective observational cohort. Conventional and high-frequency audiometry was performed in 42 music students (Madsen Itera II audiometer and TDH39P headphones for conventional audiometry, and HDA 200 headphones for high-frequency audiometry).
RESULTS: Of the 42 students, 38.1% were female students and 61.9% were male students, with a mean age of 26 years. At conventional audiometry, 92.85% had hearing thresholds within normal limits; but even within the normal limits, the worst results were observed in the left ear for all frequencies, except for 4000 Hz; compared to the non-musician group, the worst results occurred at 500 Hz in the left ear, and at 250 Hz, 6000 Hz, 9000 Hz, 10,000 Hz, and 11,200 Hz in both the ears.
CONCLUSION: The periodic evaluation of high-frequency thresholds may be useful in the early detection of hearing loss in musicians.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to: (1) estimate the hearing status of classical symphony orchestra musicians and (2) investigate the hypothesis that occupational sound exposure of symphony orchestra musicians leads to elevated hearing thresholds.
DESIGN: The study population comprised all the musicians from five symphony orchestras. Questionnaires were filled in by 337 subjects, and 212 subjects performed an audiometric test. For a group of 182 musicians (363 ears) the results of the audiometry was analyzed in relation to the individual exposure, which was estimated on the basis of sound measurements and questionnaire data regarding the exposure time. The mean hearing threshold at the frequencies 3, 4, and 6 kHz, corrected for age and sex, was used as outcome.
RESULTS: The musician ears with the highest exposure (29 of 363) had an additional threshold shift of 6.3 dB compared with the 238 ears with lowest exposure. The observed hearing loss of musicians was smaller compared with the noise-induced permanent threshold shift (NIPTS) predicted from ISO1999. A remaining confounding effect of age after ISO7029 age corrections could be observed to explain the difference in observed and predicted NIPTS. However, the observed hearing loss difference between the left and the right ear of musicians was 2.5 dB (95% confidence interval 1.5-3.6), which was similar to the NIPTS predicted from ISO1999. Most of the musicians had better hearing at 3, 4, and 6 kHz for age than expected, however, 29 ears with the highest exposure above 90.4 dBA with a mean exposure time of 41.7 years had significantly elevated hearing thresholds. Trumpet players and the left ear of first violinists had significantly elevated hearing thresholds compared with other musicians.
CONCLUSION: Most of the symphony orchestra musicians had better hearing than expected but they had a work-related risk of developing additional noise-induced hearing loss. The additional NITPS of the left ear compared with the right ear was at the expected level based on the cumulated sound exposure and ISO1999, indicating that performing music may induce hearing loss to the same extent as industrial noise.

N2  - Introduction: Research has shown that hearing loss in musicians may cause difficulty in timbre recognition and tuning of instruments. Aim: To analyze the hearing thresholds from 250. Hz to 16,000. Hz in a group of music students and compare them to a non-musician group in order to determine whether high-frequency audiometry is a useful tool in the early detection of hearing impairment. Methods: Study design was a retrospective observational cohort. Conventional and high-frequency audiometry was performed in 42 music students (Madsen Itera II audiometer and TDH39P headphones for conventional audiometry, and HDA 200 headphones for high-frequency audiometry). Results: Of the 42 students, 38.1% were female students and 61.9% were male students, with a mean age of 26 years. At conventional audiometry, 92.85% had hearing thresholds within normal limits; but even within the normal limits, the worst results were observed in the left ear for all frequencies, except for 4000. Hz; compared to the non-musician group, the worst results occurred at 500. Hz in the left ear, and at 250. Hz, 6000. Hz, 9000. Hz, 10,000. Hz, and 11,200. Hz in both the ears. Conclusion: The periodic evaluation of high-frequency thresholds may be useful in the early detection of hearing loss in musicians.

N2  - Performing artists are athletes. Like athletes, performing artists practice and/or perform most days with little off season, play through pain, "compete" in challenging environments, and risk career-threatening injury. Athletes and the Arts is a multiorganizational initiative linking the sport athlete and musician/performing artist communities. Performing artists of all ages and genre are an underserved population related to medical coverage, care, injury prevention, performance enhancement, and wellness. Sports medicine professionals are a valuable resource for filling this gap by applying existing knowledge of treating sport athletes (nutrition, injury prevention) while gaining a better understanding of performers' unique needs (hearing loss, focal dystonia) and environment. These applications can occur in the clinical setting and through developing organizational policies. By better understanding the needs of the performing arts population and applying existing concepts and knowledge, sports medicine professionals can expand their impact to a new patient base that desperately needs support.

N2  - Many amateur musicians are likely to be exposed to high sound levels during rehearsals. Measuring otoacoustic emissions (OAE) is an objective technique to assess hearing ability and can be used as an early predictor of hearing loss. This study aimed to record sound levels at an amateur brass band rehearsal and to examine the cochlear function of the musicians by evaluating distortion product (DP) OAE amplitudes before and after sound exposure. Twenty-four brass band musicians and 10 office workers were examined with personal noise measurements and DPOAE tests before and after a music rehearsal or one office workday, respectively. The sound levels in the brass band ranged from 92 to 100 dB(A), LaEQ 96 dB(A). However, the amateur brass band members had no change in DPOAEs after this exposure compared to pre-exposure levels and compared to office workers. © 2013 Science & Medicine. Funding: This work was funded by Norwegian Hydro and the Norwegian Research Council Norwegian Hydro paid half of the salaries of the persons performing the study, but the University of Bergen is owners of the data and was allowed to publish all findings in the study.

N2  - Performing arts medicine (PAM) emerged as a medical specialty around 1985. Prior to this time, relatively few publications addressed the identification and concerns of musicians' and dancers' medical problems. To determine what number and types of publications occurred prior to the actual beginnings of PAM as a discipline, and to determine how these original topics compared with present-day publications, a retrospective review of the current bibliographic database of the Performing Arts Medicine Association (PAMA) was undertaken. Out of a total of 12,600 entries to date, 489 references were found published from 1798 through 1974, which represent only 3.9% of the current database listings. One-sixth of the references were originally written in a language other than English. Journal articles were by far the most numerous type of publication. Topics with the highest number of entries included the neurobiology of music (n=77), dental/orofacial matters (71), and biographical accounts of composers or musicians and their illnesses (59). Other frequently published topics included hearing loss, physiology of playing instruments, and instrumental technique and teaching. Early topics with multiple publications included composers' biographies, dystonias, and surgery to improve finger independence for playing piano. Subjects whose publications occurred principally in the last two decades of this review included dermatological disorders, hearing loss, and ballet physiology, teaching, and technique. Those which remain popular to the present day include hearing loss, performance anxiety, focal dystonia, and dental/orofacial problems. © 2013 Science & Medicine.

N2  - Congenital amusia is a neuro-developmental disorder of music perception and production. Recent findings have demonstrated that this deficit is linked to an impaired short-term memory for tone sequences. As it has been shown before that non-musicians' implicit knowledge of musical regularities can improve short-term memory for tone information, the present study investigated if this type of implicit knowledge could also influence amusics' short-term memory performance. Congenital amusics and their matched controls, who were non-musicians, had to indicate whether sequences of five tones, presented in pairs, were the same or different; half of the pairs respected musical regularities (tonal sequences) and the other half did not (atonal sequences). As previously reported for non-musician participants, the control participants showed better performance (as measured with d) for tonal sequences than for atonal ones. While this improvement was not observed in amusics, both control and amusic participants showed faster response times for tonal sequences than for atonal sequences. These findings suggest that some implicit processing of tonal structures is potentially preserved in congenital amusia. This observation is encouraging as it strengthens the perspective to exploit implicit knowledge to help reducing pitch perception and memory deficits in amusia. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Noise exposure and hearing loss was assessed in different instrument groups of a professional ballet orchestra. Those instrument groups experiencing the highest levels of exposure also had the highest pure tone thresholds. Critically, we found that thresholds were not uniform across instrument groups. The greatest difference in thresholds was observed at test frequencies above 2000Hz, peaking at 4000Hz where the average difference between groups was as high as 15dB. The differences could not be accounted for on the basis of age, years of playing, or years of playing professionally, and are thus most likely due to differences in occupational noise exposure. Nonetheless, measured losses for all instrument groups did not approach clinically significant levels. Relevance to industry: By combining noise exposure and hearing loss assessment, this study provides information that extends current understanding of the occupational risks faced by professional musicians playing in orchestras. This information may be particularly useful in the design and implementation of hearing conservation programs. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Objectives/Hypothesis To reexamine the cause of Beethoven's hearing loss because of significant recent articles. Data Sources Medical and musical literature online, in print, and personal communication. Methods Relevant literature review. Results Evidence of otosclerosis is lacking because close gross examination of Beethoven's middle ears at autopsy did not find any otosclerotic foci. His slowly progressive hearing loss over a period of years differs from reported cases of autoimmune hearing loss, which are rapidly progressive over a period of months. He also lacked bloody diarrhea that is invariably present with autoimmune inflammatory bowel disease. The absence of mercury in Beethoven's hair and bone samples leads us to conclude that his deafness was not due to syphilis because in that era syphilis was treated with mercury. High levels of lead deep in the bone suggest repeated exposure over a long period of time rather than limited exposure prior to the time of death. The finding of shrunken cochlear nerves at his autopsy is consistent with axonal degeneration due to heavy metals such as lead. Chronic low-level lead exposure causes a slowly progressive hearing loss with sensory and autonomic findings, rather than the classic wrist drop due to motor neuropathy from sub-acute poisoning. Beethoven's physicians thought that he had alcohol dependence. He particularly liked wine that happened to be tainted with lead. Conclusions Beethoven's chronic consumption of wine tainted with lead is a better explanation of his hearing loss than other causes.

N2  - Objective. Music perception involves acoustic and auditory scene analysis, processing of interval relations, of musical syntax and semantics, and activation of premotor representations of actions. We have shown that gamma-activity during music perception especially in the prefrontal cortex reflect the processing of music in an integrated attention consciousness level. Traumatic brain injured patients (TBI) frequently fail to maintain consistent goaldirected behavior due to their impairments of sustained attention. This study aimed to clarify the role of gamma activity in normal subjects (including musicians) and in TBI during music perception. Methods. Participants were 10 normal subjects; 5 musicians (age: 21-25 years) and 5 age-matched nonmusicians and 10 patients with TBI (diffuse axonal injury and frontal contusion). Participants listened to the music from ear-phone with eyes-closed sitting in a dark experimental room. Music 1 was Anton Dvorak “From the New World Symphony” and Music 2 was Mozart Requiem K. 626. We collected spontaneous brain activity in 3 conditions; resting state with eyes-closed (for 1 minute), musiclistening and imaging the music without stimulation, examinations were performed by recording with a 60-channel EEG. Using Morlet wavelet time-frequency analysis, root mean square (RMS) was calculated in each frequency band. Results. During music listening, compared with resting state, RMS of gamma activity was significantly decreased, especially in the prefrontal cortex both in musicians and nonmusicians. During imaging the music, the musicians' gamma activity was significantly decreased in almost the entire parts, whereas the nonmusicians' gamma activity increased in the frontal lobe. Gamma-activity of TBI tended to decrease in whole brain during music listening compared with resting-state, the RMS ratio of resting-state and music listening significantly decreased in normal subjects compared with TBI in right frontal area in Music 1, in frontal area in Music 2. Discussion. TBI often results in diffuse axonal injury, which produces cognitive impairment with disconnecting nodes in distributed brain networks. Nonsignificant decrease of gamma-activity in frontal area during music perception in TBI compared with normal subjects suggests that they failed to integrate the music due to sustained attention impairments which are associated with an increase within the default mode network (DMN). Significant decrease of gamma-activity in the frontal lobe during music-listening suggests the changes in connectivity within DMN function of highly integrated self-consciousness and sustained attention.

N2  - Background: Human hearing is sensitive to sounds from as low as 20 Hz to as high as 20,000 Hz in normal ears. However, clinical tests of human hearing rarely include extended high-frequency (EHF) threshold assessments, at frequencies extending beyond 8000 Hz. EHF thresholds have been suggested for use monitoring the earliest effects of noise on the inner ear, although the clinical usefulness of EHF threshold testing is not well established for this purpose. Purpose: The primary objective of this study was to determine if EHF thresholds in healthy, young adult college students vary as a function of recreational noise exposure. Research Design: A retrospective analysis of a laboratory database was conducted; all participants with both EHF threshold testing and noise history data were included. The potential for "preclinical" EHF deficits was assessed based on the measured thresholds, with the noise surveys used to estimate recreational noise exposure. Study Sample: EHF thresholds measured during participation in other ongoing studies were available from 87 participants (34 male and 53 female); all participants had hearing within normal clinical limits (≤25 HL) at conventional frequencies (0.25-8 kHz). Results: EHF thresholds closely matched standard reference thresholds [ANSI S3.6 (1996) Annex C]. There were statistically reliable threshold differences in participants who used music players, with 3-6 dB worse thresholds at the highest test frequencies (10-16 kHz) in participants who reported long-term use of music player devices (>5 yr), or higher listening levels during music player use. Conclusions: It should be possible to detect small changes in high-frequency hearing for patients or participants who undergo repeated testing at periodic intervals. However, the increased population-level variability in thresholds at the highest frequencies will make it difficult to identify the presence of small but potentially important deficits in otherwise normal-hearing individuals who do not have previously established baseline data.

N2  - Individuals with sensorineural hearing loss have difficulty understanding speech, especially in background noise. This deficit remains even when audibility is restored through amplification, suggesting that mechanisms beyond a reduction in peripheral sensitivity contribute to the perceptual difficulties associated with hearing loss. Given that normal-hearing musicians have enhanced auditory perceptual skills, including speech-in-noise perception, coupled with heightened subcortical responses to speech, we aimed to determine whether similar advantages could be observed in middle-aged adults with hearing loss. Results indicate that musicians with hearing loss, despite self-perceptions of average performance for understanding speech in noise, have a greater ability to hear in noise relative to nonmusicians. This is accompanied by more robust subcortical encoding of sound (e.g., stimulus-to-response correlations and response consistency) as well as more resilient neural responses to speech in the presence of background noise (e.g., neural timing). Musicians with hearing loss also demonstrate unique neural signatures of spectral encoding relative to nonmusicians: enhanced neural encoding of the speech-sound's fundamental frequency but not of its upper harmonics. This stands in contrast to previous outcomes in normal-hearing musicians, who have enhanced encoding of the harmonics but not the fundamental frequency. Taken together, our data suggest that although hearing loss modifies a musician's spectral encoding of speech, the musician advantage for perceiving speech in noise persists in a hearing-impaired population by adaptively strengthening underlying neural mechanisms for speech-in-noise perception. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Background: Military musicians increasingly fulfil front line roles. Existing literature suggests that musicians are at greater risk of hearing loss than the general population. It is important to ascertain whether these findings apply to military musicians if they are to be placed in operational acoustically hazardous environments. Aims: To compare hearing loss between groups of British Army musicians and with their administrative (non-musician) counterparts. Methods: Routine health surveillance audiometric data for a group of military musicians were compared with military administrative staff during the first 8-12 years of their careers. Structured interviews were usedto identify those meeting the study inclusion criteria (8 year minimum service, no significant, relevant medical history, no previous extraordinary loud noise exposure, service within study employment group throughout military career), and to clarify the instrument played. Results: Eighty-four musicians and 44 administrators participated. Using the Health & Safety Executive's (HSE's) age- and gender-correcting system, 12 (14%) musicians and 9 (20%) non-musicians had a deterioration in hearing. The overall odds ratio for developing hearing loss in musicians was 0.65 (95% CI 0.25-1.68). Compared with woodwind instrumentalists, the odds ratio for hearing loss in brass instrumentalists was 2.00 (95% CI 0.85-3.44) and for percussionists 1.83 (95% CI 0.77-2.90). Conclusions: The findings suggest that military musicians are at no greaterrisk of hearing loss than their administrative counterparts after 8-12 years in service. This may represent a healthy-worker effect. There is no statistically significant differential risk of hearing loss between different instrumental groups. © The Author 2013.

N2  - To examine the risk for noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) in university marching band members and to provide an overview of a hearing conservation program for a marching band. Sound levels during band rehearsals were recorded and audiometric hearing thresholds and transient otoacoustic emission were measured over a 3-year period. Musician's earplugs and information about hearing loss were provided to the students. The hearing thresholds of other college students were tested as a partial control. There were no significant differences in hearing thresholds between the two groups. During initial testing, more marching band members showed apparent high-frequency notches than control students. Follow-up hearing tests in a subsequent year for the marching band members showed that almost all notches disappeared. Persistent standard threshold shift (STS) across tests was not observed in the band members. Band members showed no evidence of STS or persistent notched audiograms. Because accepted procedures for measuring hearing showed a lack of precision in reliably detecting early NIHL in marching band members, it is recommended that signs of NIHL be sought in repeated measurements compared to baseline audiograms rather than in a single measure (a single notch). A hearing conservation program for this population is still recommended because of lengthy rehearsal times with high sound-level exposure during rehearsals.

N2  - Purpose: Multiple networks of the brain are activated during music perception and production, including regions that are routinely considered for resection in the treatment of medically intractable seizures. Despite this, there is limited understanding of cortical reorganisation of music functions in epilepsy. This study examined the musical profiles of a series of patients with focal epilepsy to investigate the effects of seizures and pathology on the organisation of music networks in the brain. Method: Eleven patients (six temporal, five extra-temporal; five male; nine right-handed) were recruited from the Austin Health Comprehensive Epilepsy Program (mean age = 33.3 years, mean education = 13.5 years, mean music training = 5.0 years). Patients underwent a comprehensive music assessment of pitch, melodic, rhythmic, and metre discrimination, pitch working memory, and melodic learning. Individual performance profiles were constructed relative to published normative data. Results: Relative to normative data, temporal patients were generally impaired on melodic and rhythmic discrimination, and melodic learning, while extra-temporal patients exhibited more difficulties on metre and pitch discrimination. Compared to the extra-temporal group, temporal patients were significantly impaired on recognition of previously heard melodies (F(1,9) = 13.30 p = 0.005). There was a trend toward diminished short-term memory for pitch in the extra-temporal compared to the temporal group (F(1,9) = 3.98 p = 0.077). Strikingly, two patients with bilateral temporal lobe seizures and extensive musical training (9- 10 years) were able to successfully learn new melodies. Conclusion: These preliminary findings suggest that temporal lobe epilepsy impairs melodic discrimination, learning and recognition, however in the presence of extensive musical training, melodic learning may be preserved. This points to the possibility that training may promote reorganisation of music networks in patients with intractable seizures, which has important clinical implications for pre-surgical planning, particularly for musicians.

N2  - The ability to separate concurrent sounds based on periodicity cues is critical for parsing complex auditory scenes. This ability is enhanced in young adult musicians and reduced in older adults. Here, we investigated the impact of lifelong musicianship on concurrent sound segregation and perception using scalp-recorded ERPs. Older and younger musicians and nonmusicians were presented with periodic harmonic complexes where the second harmonic could be tuned or mistuned by 1-16% of its original value. The likelihood of perceiving two simultaneous sounds increased with mistuning, and musicians, both older and younger, were more likely to detect and report hearing two sounds when the second harmonic was mistuned at or above 2%. The perception of a mistuned harmonic as a separate sound was paralleled by an object-related negativity that was larger and earlier in younger musicians compared with the other three groups. When listeners made a judgment about the harmonic stimuli, the perception of the mistuned harmonic as a separate sound was paralleled by a positive wave at about 400 msec poststimulus (P400), which was enhanced in both older and younger musicians. These findings suggest attention-dependent processing of a mistuned harmonic is enhanced in older musicians and provides further evidence that age-related decline in hearing abilities are mitigated by musical training. © 2013 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

N2  - Older adults frequently complain that while they can hear a person talking, they cannot understand what is being said; this difficulty is exacerbated by background noise. Peripheral hearing loss cannot fully account for this age-related decline in speech-in-noise ability, as declines in central processing also contribute to this problem. Given that musicians have enhanced speech-in-noise perception, we aimed to define the effects of musical experience on subcortical responses to speech and speech-in-noise perception in middle-aged adults. Results reveal that musicians have enhanced neural encoding of speech in quiet and noisy settings. Enhancements include faster neural response timing, higher neural response consistency, more robust encoding of speech harmonics, and greater neural precision. Taken together, we suggest that musical experience provides perceptual benefits in an aging population by strengthening the underlying neural pathways necessary for the accurate representation of important temporal and spectral features of sound. © 2012 Parbery-Clark, Anderson, Hittner and Kraus.

N2  - Noise-induced hearing loss is an important public health issue, especially among musicians who are, more than any other occupation, dependent on their hearing. For them, hearing impairment is due to too loud music, the effect of which, if exceeding the limit depending on the individual sensitivity of one's ear, can be compared with the effect of noise on the ear. Risk factors for its development are: the type of musical instrument and sound character, the way of playing, music genre or composition, duration of exposure to loud music, sound source and its distance from the ear, intervals of acoustic stimuli, individual factors and the musician's position in the orchestra. Hearing impairment is greater at higher frequencies; in pure tone audiogram it is shown as notches between 3000 and 6000 Hz and is most frequent in the wind and brass section. Hearing loss is greater among violinists and typically affects the left ear owing to the sound source proximity and their position in the orchestra. The most common health problems take the form of diplacusis, algiacusis and tinnitus, as exposure to the loud acoustic stimulus above 90 dB(A) cause damage to the inner ear, the so-called acoustic trauma. Use of personal protective equipment among musicians is low especially because of too much high-frequency attenuation and occlusion effect.

N2  - Specific musical instruments can be a source of physical problems to their players. Based on reviews of the literature and personal experience, this paper summarizes current knowledge of problems affecting musicians who play instruments in the bassoon family (including the bassoon, contrabassoon, and several other instruments). Prevalence rates are higher in reports of surveys (ranging up to 86%), compared to clinical reports of patients seen and treated. Significant risk factors include young age, small body size, female gender, and use of large instruments. Problems unique to bassoonists are rare; most physical difficulties also are seen in general musculoskeletal clinical practices and in musicians playing all types of instruments. The left upper extremity is more commonly affected by overuse-related conditions in bassoonists. Non-playing-related problems are equally important for consideration (such as degenerative disorders and acute trauma), since they also affect practice and performance. Little experimental data exist to validate current and widely-held principles of treatment, rehabilitation, and prevention.

N2  - Advances in neuro-imaging have increased the detection of small vestibular schwannomas (VS) (< 25 mm). Current treatment modalities include observation with serial imaging, stereotactic radiosurgery, and microsurgical resection. No standard management consensus has been established. We seek to guide treating physicians toward the most reasonable therapeutic option based on the highest level of existing evidence, specific to the different hypothetical case scenarios. Five commonly encountered hypothetical case scenarios of patients having sporadic unilateral small VS were created, and the literature was reviewed with a focus on small VS. The data were extrapolated to our hypothetical case scenarios, and, based on the level of evidence, we discuss the most suitable patient-specific treatment strategies. Our patient scenarios were A) a 40-year-old man with small VS discovered incidentally who has normal audiometry and is a musician and inquires about which option provides the best hearing preservation; B) a 40-year-old woman with mild (but serviceable) hearing loss who wishes to undergo any management that prevents further hearing loss; C) a 40-year-old woman with serviceable hearing loss who is a newscaster and wishes to maximize her chance of facial movement preservation; D) a 40-year-old man with non-serviceable hearing loss who wishes to stabilize or restore hearing function and maximize his quality of life; and E) a 65-year-old man with significant medical comorbidities who has serviceable hearing loss and wishes to stabilize his hearing and optimize his quality of life. Observation and scan, stereotactic radiosurgery, and microsurgery are all important components of the treatment strategy. Each has unique advantages and disadvantages best suitable for certain clinical scenarios. The treatment of small VS should always be tailored to the clinical, personal, and social requirements of the individual patient, and a rigid treatment protocol is not practical.

N2  - The ability to carry a tune, natural for the majority, is underpinned by a complex functional system (i.e., the vocal sensorimotor loop, VSL). The VSL involves various components, including perceptual mechanisms, auditory-motor mapping, motor control, and memory. The malfunction of one of these components can bring about poor-pitch singing. So far, disturbed perception and deficient sensorimotor mapping have been treated as important causes of poor singing. Yet, memory has been paid relatively little attention. Here, we review results obtained from both occasional singers and individuals suffering from congenital amusia, who were asked to produce from memory or imitate a well-known melody under conditions with different memory loads. The findings point to memory as a relevant source of impairment in poor-pitch singing and to imitation as a useful aid for poor singers. © 2012 New York Academy of Sciences.

N2  - Background: Assessment of sound exposure by noise dosimetry can be challenging especially when measuring the exposure of classical orchestra musicians where sound originate from many different instruments. A new measurement method of bilateral sound exposure of classical musicians was developed and used to characterize sound exposure of the left and right ear simultaneously in two different symphony orchestras.Objectives: To measure binaural sound exposure of professional classical musicians and to identify possible exposure risk factors of specific musicians.Methods: Sound exposure was measured with microphones mounted on the musician's ears and recorded digitally. The recorded sound was analysed and the specific sound exposure of the left and the right ear was determined for the musicians. A total of 114 measurements covering 106 h were recorded in two symphony orchestras.Results: Sound exposure depends significantly on the specific instrument and the repertoire played by the exposed musician. Concerts, group rehearsals and individual practice were all significant contributors to the sound exposure. The highest LAeq of 86 -98 dB was found among the brass players. High string players were exposed from 82 to 98 dBA and their left ear was exposed 4.6 dB more than the right ear. Percussionists were exposed to high sound peaks >115 dBC but less continuous sound exposure was observed in this group. Musicians were exposed up to LAeq8h of 92 dB and a majority of musicians were exposed to sound levels exceeding LAeq8h of 85 dB.Conclusions: Binaural recording of the individual sound exposure showed that orchestra musicians could be exposed differently to the left and right ear and that they were primarily exposed from their own instruments. Specific repertoires as well as the specific instrument determine the level of exposure. © The Author 2011.

N2  - Understanding speech in a background of competing noise is challenging, especially for individuals with hearing loss or deficits in auditory processing ability. The ability to hear in background noise cannot be predicted from the audiogram, an assessment of peripheral hearing ability; therefore, it is important to consider the impact of central and cognitive factors on speech-in-noise perception. Auditory processing in complex environments is reflected in neural encoding of pitch, timing, and timbre, the crucial elements of speech and music. Musical expertise in processing pitch, timing, and timbre may transfer to enhancements in speech-in-noise perception due to shared neural pathways for speech and music. Through cognitive-sensory interactions, musicians develop skills enabling them to selectively listen to relevant signals embedded in a network of melodies and harmonies, and this experience leads in turn to enhanced ability to focus on one voice in a background of other voices. Here we review recent work examining the biological mechanisms of speech and music perception and the potential for musical experience to ameliorate speech-in-noise listening difficulties. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart - New York.

N2  - During an orchestral performance musicians are exposed to high noise levels, which may exceed the intensity which could evoke hearing impairment after many years of exposure. From experience the degree of hearing loss in musicians is in general less than would be expected from the levels of exposure. The likelihood that an orchestral musician would develop a noise-induced hearing loss is much lower than for an industrial worker in a noise-intense factory. On the other hand it has to be considered that it is imperative for musicians to have non-impaired hearing to practise their profession. In some cases a sudden onset of hearing loss is traced to the noise stress of a loud performance. In such cases, the high noise levels predominantly produced by brass instruments or drums were assumed to be the cause. This publication presents five cases of expert opinions, where previous expert opinions had assumed noise or a blast trauma as the cause for the hearing loss. By careful analysis, a noise or a blast trauma was not regarded as probable in any of the cases. Interestingly, three of the five musicians had a normal contralateral hearing. In one case normal bilateral hearing was observed without the typical c5 notch although the musician had been subject to noise stress in an orchestra for years. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

N2  - Music and Medicine are united by Mythology. Apollo links them with his lyre and the snake that accompanies him. He has two sons, one called Asclepius, the Physician, and the other called Orpheus, the Musician. Elsewhere, poor taste in music, the occasional benefits of deafness, the charisma of music, the masking effect of noise and the echo effect are personified by mythical characters like Midas, Ulysses, the Sirens, Orpheus, the Maenads or the nymph Echo. And in all these cases, the ear or the voice are part of the fabric of their marvellous adventures. So ENT is involved at a fundamental level with the stuff of legend (Figure 1). (Figure Presented).

N2  - The ENT physician and specialist in musician's medicine is consistently confronted with the issue of hearing protection, since musicians exposed to high sound levels due to their profession, and who are often concerned about their hearing, refer to him. Furthermore, this topic has gained more relevance since a noise exposure limit for professional musicians was issued in February 2008 by the EC guidelines for occupational health and safety regarding "Noise" (2003/10/EC). The present article gives an outline of the recent state of knowledge about sound pressure levels, hearing risks, as well as the use of hearing protection for musicians. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

N2  - Music involves multiple cognitive areas, musical data is processed by professional musician's preferable in the left hemisphere, whereas general subjects without musical skills with their right hemisphere. Some neurological disorders diminish or increase the musical abilities, or in some rare cases like in musicogenic epilepsy, music can triggers or induce the epileptic fits or events. The first data involving music and neurology is from professional musicians whom presented or debuted with neurological disorders and, developed alterations in their musical abilities; these first studies awaken the neuroscientific community interest in cognitive areas of music, actually some neurologic-musical disorders had been described like amusic disorder, musicogenic epilepsy, musical Savant syndrome, etc. ©INNN, 2011.

N2  - Despite a high level of sound exposure and a fairly large selection of earplugs available, musicians have often been reported to use personal hearing protectors only seldom. For better hearing conservation, it is important to identify and eliminate the causes for the low motivation to use hearing protection. We explored the usage rate of custom-molded musician's earplugs (ER-15) among 15 symphony orchestra musicians with a questionnaire, and measured the attenuation properties of their earplugs with a Real-Ear Attenuation at Threshold (REAT) procedure in a sound field. Earplug use was found to be low, and the musicians reported that earplugs hampered listening to their own and their colleagues' playing; earplugs affected either timbre or dynamics, or both. Additionally, several reasons related to discomfort of use were itemized, but the musicians who consistently used their earplugs did so in spite of problems with use. The REAT values obtained in sound field were relatively close to the manufacturer's nominal specifications, being 13.7 dB, on average. In the frequency range studied (0.125-8 kHz), individual variation in REAT was, however, up to 15 dB across the measured frequencies. Fluctuation in attenuation might be related to low use of hearing protectors, and REAT measured at fixed center frequencies may be too robust a method to uncover it. We therefore tested 10 additional subjects to find out whether a sweeping signal used in Bιkιsy audiometry would bring more detailed information on earplug attenuation. Mean attenuation was found to be somewhat closer to the nominal attenuation of the ER-9 and ER-15 earplugs up to about 1 kHz, whereas REAT measurements in sound field revealed more even attenuation at frequencies between 1 and 6 kHz. No significant association was found between earplug attenuation properties and earplug use. It was concluded that support and determination to get accustomed to hearing protector use are important factors in hearing conservation.

N2  - Ménière's syndrome appears to be the final common pathway of the mechanisms the inner ear responds to almost any injury. Although the autoimmune disease seems to play a major role, exposure to intense noise can also be a trigger in the appearance and/or aggravation of the disease. The case of 41 years old musician with a history of ankylosing spondylitis, diagnosed with Ménière's syndrome 5 years ago, is presented. Recently the symptoms became more polymorphic, revealing the association between benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), Ménière's syndrome and high frequency hearing loss in an autoimmune background. Besides general, neurological and ENT examination, the diagnostic workup comprised of tonal audiogram, brain stem auditory evoked potentials, computerized dynamic posturography and videonistagmography. The final diagnosis was acute noise trauma, Ménière's syndrome, left horizontal semicircular canal BPPV, bilateral sensorineural sudden aggravated hearing loss in high frequencies (above 9 kHz) and allegedly autoimmune inner ear disease. Treatment with an association of corticosteroids, vasodilators and vitamins combined with Vannucchi's maneuver were followed by a significant relief of the symptoms. Although no causal relationship was found between acoustic trauma and increased endolymphatic pressure, both literature data and the case presented show that intense and prolonged noise exposure may aggravate peripheral vestibular syndrome.

N2  - Background: The aim of this study was to assess sound exposure and the risk of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) in orchestral musicians. Materials and Methods: Questionnaire inquiries and sound pressure level measurements were carried out in 63 musicians. Based on these data the risk assessment of the NIHL was performed according to ISO 1999:1990 (PN-ISO 1999:1990). Results: The classical orchestral musicians are usually exposed to sound at equivalent continuous A-weighted sound pressure levels of 81-90 dB (10-90th percentile), for 20-48 h (10-90th percentile) per week. Occupational exposures to such sound levels over 40 years of employment cause the risk of hearing impairment (expressed as mean hearing threshold level for 2, 3 and 4 kHz equal or greater than 25 dB) in the range of 13-33% and 9-33% in females and males, respectively. The highest risk is related to playing clarinet (up to 33%), tube (up to 34%), trumpet (up to 37%), trombone (up to 40%), percussion section (up to 41%) and horn (up to 47%). About 46% of respondents noticed hearing impairment. Nearly every fifth musician complained of tinnitus while almost half (48%) of them - of hyperacusis. However, only 14% of musicians declared present or past usage of hearing protective devices (HPDs) while over twice of them (30%) intended to use HPDs in the future. © Instytut Medycyny Pracy im. prof.

N2  - Background: Speech-in-noise (SIN) perception is one of the most complex tasks faced by listeners on a daily basis. Although listening in noise presents challenges for all listeners, background noise inordinately affects speech perception in older adults and in children with learning disabilities. Hearing thresholds are an important factor in SIN perception, but they are not the only factor. For successful comprehension, the listener must perceive and attend to relevant speech features, such as the pitch, timing, and timbre of the target speaker's voice. Here, we review recent studies linking SIN and brainstem processing of speech sounds. Purpose: To review recent work that has examined the ability of the auditory brainstem response to complex sounds (cABR), which reflects the nervous system's transcription of pitch, timing, and timbre, to be used as an objective neural index for hearing-in-noise abilities. Study Sample: We examined speech-evoked brainstem responses in a variety of populations, including children who are typically developing, children with language-based learning impairment, young adults, older adults, and auditory experts (i.e., musicians). Data Collection and Analysis: In a number of studies, we recorded brainstem responses in quiet and babble noise conditions to the speech syllable /da/ in all age groups, as well as in a variable condition in children in which /da/ was presented in the context of seven other speech sounds. We also measured speech-in-noise perception using the Hearing-in-Noise Test (HINT) and the Quick Speech-in-Noise Test (QuickSIN). Results: Children and adults with poor SIN perception have deficits in the subcortical spectrotemporal representation of speech, including low-frequency spectral magnitudes and the timing of transient response peaks. Furthermore, auditory expertise, as engendered by musical training, provides both behavioral and neural advantages for processing speech in noise. Conclusions: These results have implications for future assessment and management strategies for young and old populations whose primary complaint is difficulty hearing in background noise. The cABR provides a clinically applicable metric for objective assessment of individuals with SIN deficits, for determination of the biologic nature of disorders affecting SIN perception, for evaluation of appropriate hearing aid algorithms, and for monitoring the efficacy of auditory remediation and training.

N2  - Background: The ability to separate two interleaved melodies is an important factor in music appreciation. This ability is greatly reduced in people with hearing impairment, contributing to difficulties in music appreciation. The aim of this study was to assess whether visual cues, musical training or musical context could have an effect on this ability, and potentially improve music appreciation for the hearing impaired. Methods: Musicians (N = 18) and non-musicians (N = 19) were asked to rate the difficulty of segregating a four-note repeating melody from interleaved random distracter notes. Visual cues were provided on half the blocks, and two musical contexts were tested, with the overlap between melody and distracter notes either gradually increasing or decreasing. Conclusions: Visual cues, musical training, and musical context all affected the difficulty of extracting the melody from a background of interleaved random distracter notes. Visual cues were effective in reducing the difficulty of segregating the melody from distracter notes, even in individuals with no musical training. These results are consistent with theories that indicate an important role for central (top-down) processes in auditory streaming mechanisms, and suggest that visual cues may help the hearing-impaired enjoy music. © 2010 Marozeau et al.

N2  - Objectives: To report an unusual observation whereby hearing was improved by insertion of cotton wool onto a retracted tympanic membrane, and to explore potential explanations for this.Case report: We report the case of a 56-year-old woman with a severe mixed hearing loss who was noted to have a significant improvement in her hearing using a technique shown to her many years ago by a Russian physician. Upon application of a moist piece of cotton wool, gains of up to 40dB were observed. This was associated with a significant subjective improvement in hearing. We discuss potential mechanisms for this effect, including amplification, a baffle effect and phase differences.Conclusion: The mechanism of the hearing improvement observed in this case is unknown, but is likely to be related to sound amplification from the relatively large surface area of the cotton wool to the smaller oval window. © 2010 JLO (1984) Limited.

N2  - The steady-state auditory evoked magnetic field was recorded in tinnitus patients and controls, both either musicians or non-musicians, all of them with high-frequency hearing loss. Stimuli were AM-tones with two modulation frequencies and three carrier frequencies matching the "audiometric edge", i.e. the frequency above which hearing loss increases more rapidly, the tinnitus frequency or the frequency 11/2 octaves above the audiometric edge in controls, and a frequency 11/2 octaves below the audiometric edge. Stimuli equated in carrier frequency, but differing in modulation frequency, were simultaneously presented to the two ears. The modulation frequency-specific components of the dual steady-state response were recovered by bandpass filtering. In both hemispheres, the source amplitude of the response was larger for contralateral than ipsilateral input. In non-musicians with tinnitus, this laterality effect was enhanced in the hemisphere contralateral and reduced in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the tinnitus ear, especially for the tinnitus frequency. The hemisphere-by-input laterality dominance effect was smaller in musicians than in non-musicians. In both patient groups, source amplitude change over time, i.e. amplitude slope, was increasing with tonal frequency for contralateral input and decreasing for ipsilateral input. However, slope was smaller for musicians than non-musicians. In patients, source amplitude was negatively correlated with the MRI-determined volume of the medial partition of Heschl's gyrus. Tinnitus patients show an altered excitatory-inhibitory balance reflecting the downregulation of inhibition and resulting in a steeper dominance hierarchy among simultaneous processes in auditory cortex. Direction and extent of this alteration are modulated by musicality and auditory cortex volume. © 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Enjoyment of music is an important part of life that may be degraded for people with hearing impairments, especially those using cochlear implants or hearing aids. Hearing impairment often leads to reduced auditory stream segregation, and hence reduced appreciation of music. Recent work in cognitive neuroscience has suggested that the integration of auditory and visual information in the brain occurs extensively, at earlier processing stages than once thought, and that sensory ambiguities can be resolved through this process. The aim of this study was to assess whether a visual cue could improve the segregation of a simple melody from a background of distracter notes. To assess the effect of training on the utility of the visual cue, trained musicians were also tested. The distracter notes varied in pitch throughout the experiment providing a range of difficulty. The results showed that for normal-hearing listeners, the visual cue reduced the difficulty of extracting the melody across a wide difficulty range, but only for non-musicians. Listeners with cochlear implants improved dramatically when using the visual cue, performing similarly to normal-hearing listeners. These results suggest that it may be possible to use a visual display to improve music appreciation for people with impaired hearing.

N2  - The steady-state auditory evoked magnetic field was recorded in tinnitus patients and controls, both either musicians or non-musicians, all of them with high-frequency hearing loss. Stimuli were AM-tones with two modulation frequencies and three carrier frequencies matching the "audiometric edge", i.e. the frequency above which hearing loss increases more rapidly, the tinnitus frequency or the frequency 11/2 octaves above the audiometric edge in controls, and a frequency 11/2 octaves below the audiometric edge. Stimuli equated in carrier frequency, but differing in modulation frequency, were simultaneously presented to the two ears. The modulation frequency-specific components of the dual steady-state response were recovered by bandpass filtering. In both hemispheres, the source amplitude of the response was larger for contralateral than ipsilateral input. In non-musicians with tinnitus, this laterality effect was enhanced in the hemisphere contralateral and reduced in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the tinnitus ear, especially for the tinnitus frequency. The hemisphere-by-input laterality dominance effect was smaller in musicians than in non-musicians. In both patient groups, source amplitude change over time, i.e. amplitude slope, was increasing with tonal frequency for contralateral input and decreasing for ipsilateral input. However, slope was smaller for musicians than non-musicians. In patients, source amplitude was negatively correlated with the MRI-determined volume of the medial partition of Heschl's gyrus. Tinnitus patients show an altered excitatory-inhibitory balance reflecting the downregulation of inhibition and resulting in a steeper dominance hierarchy among simultaneous processes in auditory cortex. Direction and extent of this alteration are modulated by musicality and auditory cortex volume. © 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background: Speech-in-noise (SIN) perception is one of the most complex tasks faced by listeners on a daily basis. Although listening in noise presents challenges for all listeners, background noise inordinately affects speech perception in older adults and in children with learning disabilities. Hearing thresholds are an important factor in SIN perception, but they are not the only factor. For successful comprehension, the listener must perceive and attend to relevant speech features, such as the pitch, timing, and timbre of the target speaker's voice. Here, we review recent studies linking SIN and brainstem processing of speech sounds. Purpose: To review recent work that has examined the ability of the auditory brainstem response to complex sounds (cABR), which reflects the nervous system's transcription of pitch, timing, and timbre, to be used as an objective neural index for hearing-in-noise abilities. Study Sample: We examined speech-evoked brainstem responses in a variety of populations, including children who are typically developing, children with language-based learning impairment, young adults, older adults, and auditory experts (i.e., musicians). Data Collection and Analysis: In a number of studies, we recorded brainstem responses in quiet and babble noise conditions to the speech syllable/da/in all age groups, as well as in a variable condition in children in which/da/was presented in the context of seven other speech sounds. We also measured speech-in-noise perception using the Hearing-in-Noise Test (HINT) and the Quick Speech-in-Noise Test (QuickSIN). Results: Children and adults with poor SIN perception have deficits in the subcortical spectrotemporal representation of speech, including low-frequency spectral magnitudes and the timing of transient response peaks. Furthermore, auditory expertise, as engendered by musical training, provides both behavioral and neural advantages for processing speech in noise. Conclusions: These results have implications for future assessment and management strategies for young and old populations whose primary complaint is difficulty hearing in background noise. The cABR provides a clinically applicable metric for objective assessment of individuals with SIN deficits, for determination of the biologic nature of disorders affecting SIN perception, for evaluation of appropriate hearing aid algorithms, and for monitoring the efficacy of auditory remediation and training.

N2  - Experimental and epidemiological research indicate an association between long-term stress and hearing problems, yet the mechanisms underlying these disorders are not yet fully established. Thus, in order to better understand the pathogenesis of stress-related hearing problems, the present study explored the symptoms and general physiological and psychosocial status of musicians in symphony orchestras. Orchestral musicians are an ideal group to study since physical, psychosocial, work-environmental and acoustic stressors are highly prevalent. The subjects where obtained from two different studies. The first group included 250 participants from 12 orchestras and is entitled "the epidemiological study". The second group, entitled "the longitudinal study", included 47 musicians who were assessed at five occasions (every half year) during two years. Thirty-one of the 47 participants were selected for sampling of physiological variables, i.e. 24-hour ECG to assess heart rate variability to evaluate the synergistic action of the autonomic system as well as saliva cortisol and testosterone levels. The results indicate that self-reported hearing problems are associated with perceived poorer psychosocial environment, as well as mental health symptoms and stress. High-frequency power of heart rate variability (parasympathetic activity) showed a negative relationship to hearing problems, implying a poorer ability to "unwind" from stress. Cortisol levels were not correlated to hearing problems whereas testosterone levels showed a tendency to be lower in subjects with hearing problems than in others. These findings provide evidence for a relationship between long-term stress and self-reported hearing problems and demonstrate a protective role of parasympathetic and anabolic activity on hearing status. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - The great irony of being a musician is that the sound produced-the very essence of the musical experience - represents a long-term health risk to the artist. This overview examines the lack of sufficient evidence-based studies on this at-risk population, which is particularly important in light of the low level of compliance to hearing-loss prevention programs among musicians. The review explores the number of musicians at risk, the five most common types of hearing loss affecting them, and the necessary components of a hearing-loss prevention program, including measurement, education, and acoustic modifications to the work environment. Hearing protection devices designed specifically for performing musicians are explored in depth, including the proper use of spectrum-neutral high-fidelity earplugs with in-ear monitoring systems as tools to control sound levels without detracting from the quality of musical performance.

N2  - The purpose of this study was 1) to examine the sound exposure of wind band members in a university setting during a week of typical rehearsals and 2) to assess whether that exposure changes depending on subjects' location within the rehearsal space. Because excessive sound exposure has a cumulative effect on the ear that can eventually lead to noise-induced bearing loss, it is important to determine whether university musicians are at risk. A 100% close of sound is the maximum daily exposure recommended by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) for preventing noise-induced hearing loss. Twenty-four of 46 subjects (52%) experienced one or more rehearsals with sound levels high enough to produce >100% doses, and 17 subjects experienced a mean daily dose of sound in excess of 100% as compared to the NIOSH standards. Implications and suggestions for further research are discussed.

N2  - The neural basis of tinnitus is unknown. Recent neuroimaging studies point towards involvement of several cortical and subcortical regions. Here we demonstrate that tinnitus may be associated with structural changes in the auditory cortex. Using individual morphological segmentation, the medial partition of Heschl's gyrus (mHG) was studied in individuals with and without chronic tinnitus using magnetic resonance imaging. Both the tinnitus and the non-tinnitus group included musicians and non-musicians. Patients exhibited significantly smaller mHG gray matter volumes than controls. In unilateral tinnitus, this effect was almost exclusively seen in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the affected ear. In bilateral tinnitus, mHG volume was substantially reduced in both hemispheres. The tinnitus-related volume reduction was found across the full extent of mHG, not only in the high-frequency part usually most affected by hearing loss-induced deafferentation. However, there was also evidence for a relationship between volume reduction and hearing loss. Correlations between volume and hearing level depended on the subject group as well as the asymmetry of the hearing loss. The volume changes observed may represent antecedents or consequences of tinnitus and tinnitus-associated hearing loss and also raise the possibility that small cortical volume constitutes a vulnerability factor. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Objectives: An investigation of the hearing status of musicians of professional symphony orchestras. Main questions are: (1) Should musicians be treated as a special group with regard to hearing, noise, and noise related hearing problems (2) Do patterns of hearing damage differ for different instrument types (3) Do OAE have an added value in the diagnosis of noise induced hearing loss (NIHL) in musicians. Methods: 241 professional musicians, aged between 23-64 participated. A brief medical history and the subjective judgment of their hearing and hearing problems were assessed. Musicians were subjected to an extensive audiological test battery, which contained testing of audiometric thresholds, loudness perception, diplacusis, tinnitus, speech perception in noise, and otoacoustic emissions. Results: Most musicians could be categorized as normal hearing, but their audiograms show notches at 6 kHz, a frequency that is associated with NIHL. Musicians often complained about tinnitus and hyperacusis, while diplacusis was generally not reported as a problem. Tinnitus was most often localized utmost left and this could not be related to the instrument. It was usually perceived in high frequency areas, associated with NIHL. In general, musicians scored very well on the speech-in-noise test. The results of the loudness perception test were within normal limits. Otoacoustic emissions were more intense with better pure-tone thresholds, but due to large individual differences it can still not be used as an objective test for early detection of NIHL. Conclusions: Musicians show more noise induced hearing loss than could be expected on the basis of age and gender. Other indicators, such as complaints and prevalence of tinnitus, complaints about hyperacusis and prevalence of diplacusis suggest that musicians' ears are at risk. Continuing education about the risks of intensive sound exposure to musicians, with the emphasis on the possible development of tinnitus and hyperacusis and the need for good hearing protection is warranted. © The Author(s) 2008.

N2  - Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is a major health problem that affects an estimated 16.1% of American adults, but for musicians, the onset of noise-induced, or any type of hearing loss, can be a career-changing event. The potential for dangerous sound pressure levels in musical environments has been documented in numerous studies, with exposures in both short and long durations shown to be harmful. Yet, in theory, NIHL is completely preventable. This review discusses basic information concerning the hearing mechanism and NIHL, audiometry, standards, protective strategies, and terminology. It aims to provide a general understanding of these processes as they relate to musicians and other performing artists.

N2  - Professional orchestral musicians are at risk of exposure to excessive noise when at work. This is an industry-wide problem that threatens not only the hearing of orchestral musicians but also the way orchestras operate. The research described in this paper recorded noise levels within a professional orchestra over three years in order to provide greater insight to the orchestral noise environment; to guide future research into orchestral noise management and hearing conservation strategies; and to provide a basis for the future education of musicians and their managers. Every rehearsal, performance, and recording from May 2004 to May 2007 was monitored, with the woodwind, brass, and percussion sections monitored in greatest detail. The study recorded dBALEQ and dBC peak data, which are presented in graphical form with accompanying summarized data tables. The findings indicate that the principal trumpet, first and third horns, and principal trombone are at greatest risk of exposure to excessive sustained noise levels and that the percussion and timpani are at greatest risk of exposure to excessive peak noise levels. However, the findings also strongly support the notion that the true nature of orchestral noise is a great deal more complex than this simple statement would imply. © 2008 Acoustical Society of America.

N2  - Despite the fact that the Heschl gyrus (HG) is a crucial brain structure as it contains the primary auditory cortex (PAC), relatively few structural MRI studies have concentrated upon it. We propose that this may be attributed in part to the considerable variability of this structure and, most importantly, to the lack of unified criteria for defining the extent of the PAC along the MRI-determined landmarks of the HG, which ultimately affects the reliability and reproducibility of these studies. This review highlights three aspects: first, the standard and variant anatomy of the HG and PAC with particular focus on MRI definition of these regions; second, the importance of studying the HG and PAC in health and disease using structural MRI; and, third, the problem of MRI localization of the PAC. The scientific community should be aware that the HG and its included PAC are not synonyms. Additionally, owing to the great complexity and variability of these regions, future MRI studies should be cautious when using single brain-based atlas or maps generated by simply averaging across individuals to localize these regions. Instead, and while waiting for future in vivo microstructural localization of the PAC, the use of probabilistic and functional maps is advantageous but not without shortcomings. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - Introduction: The aim of this study is to detect the problems related to wind instruments in order to determine the contributing factors. Material and method: This study is a prospective study of a sample of Lebanese wind-instruments musicians. Questionnaire of 17 items about personal data, musical activities in general and specific problems related to wind instruments. Results: 340 response out of 400 (85%). Gender: male 100%. Age: 28.5 ± 6.5 years (13-50). Practice of any physical activity: 57.5 %. Smokers: 40.5% · Data about musical practice - Years of practice: 6.5 ± 5.5. Daily practice: 2.5 ± 1.5 hours with 3.5 ± 2 rest periods of 16.5 ± 15 minutes. Weekly practice: 5 ± 2 days · Data about medical problems - Hear loss 34 %; respiratory difficulties: 19.5%; wound of lips muscles: 5%; gums and tongue lesions: 7.8%; myospasms of the cheeks and lips: 34.5%; dental problems: 30.7%; temporo-mandibular disorders (TMD): 22.5%. There is a high association between risk factors and pathology. Risks related to the instrument's use: hear loss (p = 0.001), traumas to lips muscles (p = 0.065), myospasms (p = 0.064), TMD (p = OAM). Other factors: physical activity is beneficial; smoking is harmful (breathing difficulties, spasms, headaches). Factors influencing the different problems: age (31 ± 7 years); years of practice (9 ± 6); hours of practice per day (2 ± 1.5); days of practice per week (4.5 ± 2.5). Conclusion: Wind instruments are related to problems of mouth, facial muscles and hearing. This may lead musicians to stop their activities or to irreversible professional disabilities. A medical follow-up during the musicians training is needed to prevent these problems.

N2  - The sound in classical orchestral music is louder than noise emissions allowed by national rules in industry. We wanted to assess the audiologic status of professional musicians at different ages of their careers and to look for a coherence of declined hearing ability and the sound emissions in order to substantiate advices for hearing protection and occupational medicine in musicians. Data from questionnaires (anamnestic data on sound exposure in profession and leisure times, use of hearing protection, self-evaluation of hearing function and hearing deficits), audiometric data and amplitudes of OAE were evaluated from 109 professional musicians aged 30-69 years from three major German orchestras and from 110 students of an academy of music (aged 11-19 years). Sound emissions of the whole orchestra and of single instruments/instrument groups were measured at the orchestra stages and pits during rehearsals and performances. None of the musicians was engaged in noisy hobbies and only a few used hearing protectors regularly. More than 50% of the musicians had a hearing loss of 15 dB(A) and more. Highest losses were found among the strings and the brass players. DPOAE amplitudes coincidently declined with the duration of performing music in the orchestras. Professional musicians aged older than 60 years had a significantly greater hearing loss at 4 and 6 kHz than those aged 30-39 years. Among the strings in one orchestra a dominant hearing deficit in the left ears was observed. Musicians need the same health care for their hearing as workers in noisy industry. A better education on the hearing hazards (use of hearing protectors) as well as sound protection in the rehearsal rooms is necessary. Hearing loss in professional musicians should be accepted as an occupational disease. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.

N2  - Musicians in symphony orchestras are exposed to harmful sound levels. Although research shows that industrial workers have a higher propensity to noise-induced hearing loss, musicians can also develop a hearing loss from noise exposure. Furthermore, musicians can suffer from tinnitus, hyperacusis, and distortion, among other hearing disorders, which can affect their work more severely than a hearing loss. This study investigated the use of hearing protectors, the prevalence of self-reported hearing disorders among musicians, and the importance of these hearing disorders to the musicians. The musicians at three Danish symphony orchestras were asked to complete a questionnaire on the topic. Results showed that Danish musicians are aware of the dangers of loud music, yet they rarely use hearing protectors and not always correctly; however, musicians with hearing disorders use hearing protectors more frequently. In addition, the musicians questioned suffered from different hearing disorders. Education is needed to change musicians' opinion of hearing conservation and hearing protectors. The education must be directed to both the musicians and the administration of the symphony orchestras. © 2008 British Society of Audiology, International Society of Audiology, and Nordic Audiological Society.

N2  - Hearing threshold and survey data collected over 3 years in a university school of music indicate that 52% of undergraduate music students show declines in high-frequency hearing at 6000 Hz consistent with acoustic overexposure. Declines at 4000 Hz have grown in number over the 3 years, from 2% the first year to 30% in the third year. These "noise notches" are seen in all instrument groups, including voice, and are seen more in the right ear than the left ear in all groups. Exposure to outside noise does not appear to be a determining factor in who develops these declines. It is concluded that genetic predisposition is a likely risk factor.

N2  - Purpose: This study examined the impact that changing on-stage music and crowd noise levels during musical performance had on preferred listening levels (PLLs) and minimum acceptable listening levels (MALLs) across both floor and in-ear monitors. Method: Participants for this study were 23- to 48-year-old musicians, with and without hearing loss, who had 10 years of musical training or comparable professional experience. For this study, PLLs and MALLs were established for the musician's own voice, whereas the levels of other onstage musical signals were systematically varied. PLLs for in-ear monitors were found at significantly lower levels than for floor monitors (approximately 0.6 dB). Results: PLLs for in-ear monitors were found at significantly lower levels than for floor monitors (approximately 0.6 dB). However, despite large spectral differences, PLLs across the 2 monitor types were small enough that the same recommended exposure time would be advocated based on National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health and Occupational Safety and Health Administration recommendations. MALL data also indicated significantly lower levels (approximately 6.0 dB) when musicians were using in-ear monitors in comparison to floor monitors. Conclusion: The much larger difference suggests that musicians' risk of noise exposure may be reduced by the use of in-ear monitors. However, given the similar PLL results and known monitor output levels, proper counseling would likely be required before this potential advantage would be realized. © American Speech-Language-Hearing Association.

N2  - Objectives: Prior to this study, it was not clear how familiar orchestral musicians were with the various insertable models of hearing protectors. The present study focuses on musicians and entertainers and proposes the maintenance of a noise exposure limit through the use of a hearing protector. Materials and Methods: This study was conducted by distributing a questionnaire to musicians ( n = 429) in nine orchestras in order to obtain information on the use of hearing protection and the musicians' hearing sensitivity. Results: Hearing protectors were found to be seldom used by orchestral musicians. During orchestral rehearsals, < 1/6 of the test persons used Type 1 (individually fitted) hearing protectors although >80% of the respondents indicated that they knew about them. A gap emerged between what seemed most important to musicians in hearing protectors and what was provided by the manufacturers. Conclusions: The subject of hearing protection in orchestral musicians should be investigated with a multidimensional approach which considers the following in equal measure: legal regulations, the requirements and limits of the music sector and the individual characteristics of the musicians involved.

N2  - Twenty-seven student musicians were surveyed regarding musical practice and playing habits, knowledge of hearing conservation practices, use of hearing protective devices (HPD), and the occurrence of tinnitus after exposure to loud music. In addition, noise exposure levels during practice and sporting events (football and basketball games) at which they played were monitored with a dosimeter simultaneously set to measure noise levels using the OSHA (1983) and NIOSH (1998) measurement criteria. Forty-eight percent of the subjects reported practicing or playing their instrument >10 hours a week. Most musicians (74%) reported having been taught about the effects of noise on hearing and health; however, less than a third used car protection while playing their instruments, and those who did used it inconsistently. Sixty-three percent of subjects reported experiencing tinnitus after exposure to loud music. Finally, 8-hour time-weighted averages (TWA) and daily noise doses were significantly higher using the NIOSH measurement criteria than the OSHA measurement criteria. Both measurement criteria yielded values that exceeded a 100% daily noise dose for all subjects. Overall, these results indicate that university student directors and musicians appear to be at high risk for permanent noise-induced hearing loss secondary to excessive exposure to loud music. These results support the need for on-going hearing conservation programs to educate student musicians and student directors about the dangers of excessive exposure to loud music.

N2  - Objective: To confirm the existence of acoustic trauma in classical musicians. Material and method: Sixty-five volunteers from the Castilla and León Symphony Orchestra were studied. The hearing thresholds of each musician were age-corrected using the ELI and ISO 7029:2000 scales. Furthermore the sound levels of the instruments in this symphony orchestra were studied. Results:We observed that the sound level of the symphony orchestra instruments is higher than the level permitted by law, ie it constitutes a risk for hearing loss. We also found that 4 kHz hearing loss in the 5th percentile among musicians was double the rate that would be expected for age, and that violinists and viola players showed poorer hearing in the left ear. Conclusions: Classical music causes acoustic trauma in musicians and should be recognized as a professional illness. Musicians are obliged to protect their hearing and to undergo regular check-ups.

N2  - In the last decade, a considerable number of studies have been made on the cognitive processing of music. A patient with pure amusia due to the infarction of anterior portion of bilateral temporal lobes revealed the disturbance of the discrimination of chords. Using positron emission tomography, these regions were activated when musically naïve normal subjects listened to the harmony compared to the rhythm of identical music. So, we concluded that anterior temporal portion might participate in the recognition of chords. Several articles reported that the musician's brain was different from nonmusicians' functionally and anatomically. This difference was considered to be caused by the musical training for a long time. Recent studies clarified that the reorganization might occur by musical training for a few months. Melodic intonation therapy (MIT) is a method aimed to improve speech output of aphasie patients, using short melodic phrase with a word. The literatures of mental processing of music suggested that right hemisphere might participate in the expression of music, namely singing and playing instrumentais. So, it was supposed that MIT utilized the compensational function of right hemisphere for damaged left hemisphere. We also reported that mental singing improved the gait disturbance of patients with Parkinson's disease. Music therapy is changing from a social science model based on the individual experiences to a neuroscience-guided model based on brain function and cognitive processing of the perception and expression of music.

N2  - Purpose: We review a series of experiments aimed at studying pitch processing in music and speech. These studies were conducted with musician and non musician adults and children. We found that musical expertise improved pitch processing not only in music but also in speech. Demonstrating transfer of training between music and language has interesting applications for second language learning. We also addressed the issue of whether the positive effects of musical expertise are linked with specific predispositions for music or with extensive musical practice. Results of longitudinal studies argue for the later. Finally, we also examined pitch processing in dyslexic children and found that they had difficulties discriminating strong pitch changes that are easily discriminate by normal readers. These results argue for a strong link between basic auditory perception abilities and reading abilities. Methods: We used conjointly the behavioral method (Reaction Times and error rates) and the electrophysiological method (recording of the changes in brain electrical activity time-locked to stimulus presentation, Event-Related brain Potentials or ERPs). Results: A set of common processes may be responsible for pitch processing in music and in speech and these processes are shaped by musical practice. Conclusion: These data add evidence in favor of brain plasticity and open interesting perspectives for the remediation of dyslexia using musical training. © 2007 - IOS Press and the authors.

N2  - Amusia (commonly referred to as tone-deafness) is a difficulty in discriminating pitch changes in melodies that affects around 4% of the human population. Amusia cannot be explained as a simple sensory impairment. Here we show that amusia is strongly related to a deficit in spatial processing in adults. Compared to two matched control groups (musicians and non-musicians), participants in the amusic group were significantly impaired on a visually presented mental rotation task. Amusic subjects were also less prone to interference in a spatial stimulus-response incompatibility task and performed significantly faster than controls in an interference task in which they were required to make simple pitch discriminations while concurrently performing a mental rotation task. This indicates that the processing of pitch in music normally depends on the cognitive mechanisms that are used to process spatial representations in other modalities. © 2007 Nature Publishing Group.

N2  - We reviewed 13 papers on noise exposure of orchestral musicians and found that the question of whether orchestra musicians are overexposed does not appear to have a clear answer. To find relevant papers, we researched three databases (Scholar, Scopos, and Medline), which yielded 6, 9, and 17 papers, respectively (including duplicates). A number of papers in the reviewed literature lacked basic descriptions concerning such issues as measurement technique and instrumentation. Rough data and calculation details were often not provided so that the conclusions could not be checked easily. The most serious problem was the estimated time that musicians performed in the orchestra. This information is crucial for the calculation of the normalized noise exposure levels (L EX), and is especially important as orchestra players do not perform year-round nor are they exposed to the same noise levels while performing different pieces of music.

N2  - The aim of this cross-sectional study was to describe self-reported problems among guitarists and to examine differences associated with type of guitar played. Data for the study were extracted from the University of North Texas Musician Health Survey (UNT-MHS) data set. Subjects for the present study (n = 520) were included if they identified acoustic guitar, electric guitar, electric bass or banjo as their primary instrument. Prevalences for musculoskeletal problems were determined for the total group, by guitar-specific groups, and by gender. Prevalences for nonmusculoskeletal, overall health problems were established for the whole guitar group and by instrument. Of the total subjects, 81% reported one or more musculoskeletal problems. The acoustic guitar group reported the highest prevalence (83%), followed by the banjo (78%), electric bass (77%), and electric guitar groups (74%). The highest site-specific prevalences for the whole group were the left fingers (32.9%), left wrist (29.8%), and left hand (24.7%). Regarding non-musculoskeletal problems, 66% of the total group perceived stress due to work environment as a moderate to high problem. The total group reported mostly problems with fatigue, depression, headache, and eye strain. The overall findings of the study show that musculoskeletal problems as well as stress-related health problems are a major concern for the guitar community.

N2  - The quality of movements in musicians while playing is decisive both for the acoustic results and for the musicians' health. Overuse syndromes due to less than optimal playing motions and excessive practice are among the most frequent disorders with which musicians' medicine is confronted. Successful intermediate-range and long-range treatment thus require high-quality work to inculcate healthy posture and motion while making music. There are a number of methods which can be employed for musicians: body-oriented methods which arose at the beginning of the past century such as Ideokinesis, Feldenkrais-Method, Alexander-Technique, and Eutony-Gerda-Alexander; in addition, there are relatively recent methods available such as Dispokinesis, functional motion training, and breath training according to Schlaffhorst-Andersen and Middendorf, as well as methods from the Asiatic sphere such as Yoga, Qi-Gong, and Tai-Chi. Particularly in the primary and secondary preventive area, motion-oriented methods - individually or combined with other physiotherapeutic measures, orthopaedics, and psychosomatic medicine - are indispensable components of the treatments offered by musicians' medicine. Where motion pedagogy and motion therapy overlap, somagogics are currently being established as a new, independent specialty, combining research into the effectiveness of those body-oriented methods listed above with their practical usage. © 2006 Schattauer GmbH.

N2  - Hearing is the sense of man which never sleeps. Through the ear, we perceive, among other things, voices and music; moreover, the ear also warns us against approaching dangers that manifest themselves acoustically. However, the ear can unfold and lastingly maintain its astonishing capabilities as long as it remains undamaged by too many loud noises. Musicians, while pursuing their profession, are frequently subjected to decibel levels which, in the long run, may lead to hearing impairment. As the decibel level can neither be reduced by architectural measures nor by generally soft playing to the point where hearing damage can be ruled out, each musician should acguire intensive knowledge to determine whether and how he, as an individual, can protect himself in his own particular case. Each musician should grant his sense of hearing regular rest periods and should have his hearing examined regularly, in order to recognize possible impairment promptly. © 2006 Schattauer GmbH.

N2  - Support for the existence of a neural network in the brain dedicated to processing music can be found in the observation of remarkable preservation or selective loss of musical perception or production in cases with a brain damage. To illustrate the modularity of the brain musical system, several case-reports of patients with focal brain lesions that involve selective musical deficits or preservation are presented. All the cases were quantitatively tested with our own standardized test battery already validated in the normal population. The first case exhibited a selective deficit of melodic abilities in the production mode (singing songs), however, with preserved temporal analysis (rhythm and metre), lyrics and prosody, all due to a lesion of the right temporal lobe of the non-dominant hemisphere. In the second case, a selective deficit of melodic perception of interval and rhythm (known as local analytical mechanisms) with preserved contour and metre was recorded. The lesion was unexpectedly localised in the fronto-parietal lobe of the right (non-dominant) hemisphere of a non-musician. The third case, with a fronto-temporal lesion of the left (dominant) hemisphere, demonstrated relative preservation of lyrics (together with intact intonation) as opposed to severely disturbed spontaneous speech in a patient with global aphasia. The opposite dissociation was documented in the fourth case suffering from a similar focal temporo-insular lesion of the left (dominant) hemisphere with chronic anomic aphasia and fluent spontaneous speech, but a severe deficit in producing previously-known lyrics. Various patterns of amusia have been discussed within the framework of current theories and modular concepts on the function and structure of the musical brain system.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the hearing and subjective auditory symptoms in a group of nonprofessional pop/rock musicians who had experienced repeated exposures to intense sound levels during at least 5 yr of musical activity. DESIGN: An evaluation of both ears in 42 nonprofessional pop/rock musicians included pure-tone audiometry in the conventional and extended high-frequency range, the measurement of uncomfortable loudness levels, and an assessment of tinnitus and hypersensitivity to sound. Exclusion criteria were (a) the occurrence of acoustic trauma, (b) excessive noise exposure during occupational activities, (c) a history of recurrent otitis media, (d) previous ear surgery, (e) a fracture of the cranium, (f) ingestion of potentially ototoxic drugs, and (g) reported hearing difficulties within the immediate family. These audiometric results were then compared with a control group of 20 otologically normal young adults with no history of long-term noise exposure. RESULTS: After adjusting for age and gender, relative to ISO 7029, the mean hearing threshold in the frequency range of 3 to 8 kHz was 6 dB in the musicians and 1.5 dB in the control group. This difference was statistically significant (Mann-Whitney rank sum test, p < 0.001). A significant difference was also observed between musicians using regular hearing protection during their activities (average 3 to 8 kHz thresholds = 2.4 dB) and musicians who never used such hearing protection (average 3 to 8 kHz thresholds = 8.2 dB), after adjusting for age and gender (Mann-Whitney rank sum test, p = 0.006). Eleven of the musicians (26%) were found to be hypersensitive to sound, and seven (17%) presented with tinnitus. Tinnitus assessment, however, did not reveal any clinically significant psychological distress in these individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Tinnitus and hypersensitivity to sound were observed in a significant minority within a group of nonprofessional pop/rock musicians who had experienced repeated exposure to intense sound levels over at least 5 yr but with minimal impact on their lives. Moreover, hearing loss was minimal in the subjects who always used ear protection, being only 0.9 dB higher than the control group. In contrast, hearing loss was significantly more pronounced, at 6.7 dB higher than the control group, in those musicians who never used ear protection. Continued education about the risk to hearing and the benefits of the persistent use of ear protection is warranted for musicians who are exposed frequently to intense sound levels.

N2  - The three related studies of percussionists' hearing and their use of protection show that their auditory thresholds are 5 to 11 dB worse than age- and gender-matched peers with no history of routine exposure to loud sound. The prevalence of hearing loss (PTA ≥25 db HL) is estimated to be 39% among percussionists, whereas in the general population it is approximately 9%. Even when they did not have hearing loss, the percussionists appeared to be more subject to "sub-clinical" damage to the outer hair cells than a comparable sample of normal-hearing subjects without a history of exposure to loud noise or music. Among the percussionists, otoacoustic emissions were more often absent or reduced in amplitude than in the normal-hearing sample. Percussionists who use HPDs always or sometimes have significantly better OAEs than those who do not. It is recommended that OAE measurements be performed as a routine aspect of the audiologic evaluation for percussionists. Although percussionists are generally aware of both the dangers of repeated exposure to loud music and the benefits of HPD use, their compliance in using these devices is disappointing. Evidence suggests, however, that a brief educational intervention can be effective in improving compliance. It seems reasonable to believe that once musicians experience the benefits of these devices, they will be likely to continue their use.

N2  - This study was undertaken to quantify hearing thresholds in a large sample of percussionists and to evaluate factors that might increase or decrease a percussionist's risk for music-induced hearing loss. Audiometric and musical history data were collected from 315 percussionists attending the Percussive Arts Society International Convention in Louisville, Kentucky, in November 2004. Hearing thresholds for percussionists were compared to an age- and gender-matched, otologically normal reference population. Results indicate that hearing thresholds of percussionists are significantly worse than those of their age- and gender-matched peers, although differences appear to be small. Hearing was worse in the left ear of percussionists. The prevalence of hearing loss was 39% in percussionists vs. 9% in the reference population. Factors identified as increasing the risk for hearing loss included using amplification systems, playing rock/pop music, having more years of experience, and considering oneself a professional. Increased playing time and playing classical or jazz music were not found to increase a percussionist's risk for hearing loss. Benefits of wearing hearing protection devices (HPDs) were observed only for individuals who used foam earplugs when practicing. It is recommended that percussionists not only use HPDs and decrease practice and performance intensity levels but also participate in annual audiologic evaluations, including otoacoustic emission testing, to prevent music-induced hearing loss.

N2  - The present study was undertaken to investigate the behaviors and attitudes of percussionists regarding hearing conservation. Little is known about the frequency with which percussionists use hearing protection, the reasons for non-use, and their general knowledge about music-induced hearing loss. Using a written survey or personal interview, we surveyed approximately 500 amateur and professional percussionists who attended two local percussionists' conventions, which produced 283 completed surveys. This article describes the frequency of hearing protection device (HPD) use, reasons for non-use, types of HPD used, the advantages and disadvantages of wearing HPDs from the percussionists' point of view, sources where percussionists obtained information regarding HPDs, time of their most recent purchase, and accuracy of percussionists' knowledge of music-induced hearing loss and HPDs.

N2  - Among artists, musicians suffer from special health problems related to their occupation and lifestyle. These mainly include musculoskeletal disorders, skin disorders, respiratory disorders, and noise induced hearing impairment. In this review we point out the most prevalent health problems that musicians face in their professional lives as well as the means to prevent them. The characteristics of individual performer and the type of instrument that he/she plays will determine the occupational disorder or disease that a musician may suffer from. The main worry about health problems in musicians is that they can become potentially career-ending disabilities. Therefore well-planned preventive strategies should be employed to help musicians in obtaining long and healthy career.

N2  - Percussionists can be exposed to intermittent sound stimuli that exceed 145 dB SPL, although damage may occur to the outer hair cells at levels of 120 dB SPL. The present study measured distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) in a group of 86 normal-hearing percussionists and 39 normal-hearing nonpercussionists. Results indicate that normal-hearing percussionists have lower DPOAE amplitudes than normal-hearing nonpercussionists. DPOAE amplitudes were significantly lower at 6000 Hz in both the left and right ears for percussionists. Percussionists also more frequently had absent DPOAEs, with the greatest differences occurring at 6000 Hz (absent DPOAEs in 25% of percussionists vs 10% of nonpercussionists). When all frequencies are considered as a group, 33% of the percussionists had an absent DPOAE in either ear at some frequency, compared to only 23% of the nonpercussionists. Otoacoustic emissions are more sensitive to outer hair cell damage than pure-tone threshold measurements and can serve as an important measurement of sensory loss (i.e., outer hair cell damage) in musicians before the person perceives the hearing loss. DPOAE monitoring for musicians, along with appropriate education and intervention, might help prevent or minimize music-induced hearing loss.

N2  - The aim was to determine the incidence of tinnitus, impaired hearing and musculoskeletal disorders among musicians and the relation to the number of practicing hours and/or the instrument type before the onset of symptoms. Method: The study base consisted of students enroled in the School of Music and Music Education at Göteborg University between the years 1980 and 1995. There were 407 of the 602 original students that answered a questionnaire (response rate of 68%). The questionnaire concerned exposure before and after the enrolment in the Music Academy, as well as onset of symptoms. Results: The highest incidence of symptoms was found for reported tinnitus with a rate of 10.6 per 1000 years of instrumental practice. There was a relationship between exposure to the number of hours of instrumental practice and incidence of impaired hearing. Among the musculoskeletal symptoms the highest incidences per 1000 years of instrumental practice were pain in the neck and in the left shoulder with a rate of 4.4 and 4.6 disorders per 1000 years of instrumental practice, respectively. There was 2.4 times higher incidence for musculoskeletal disorders in the right hand/wrist and a 2.2 times higher incidence in the left elbow/forearm for musicians who practiced for 20 h or more per week before the onset of disorders compared to those who practiced fewer than 20 h per week when controlling for age and gender. Musicians with a violin or a viola as the main instrument had four times the incidence for right elbow/forearm disorder and twice the incidence of neck pain, pain in the right shoulder and the left elbow/forearm compared to those who had piano as the main instrument. © 2005 Springer-Verlag.

N2  - A central tenet in brain research is that early sensory cortex is modality specific, and, only in exceptional cases, such as deaf and blind subjects or professional musicians, is influenced by other modalities. Here we describe extensive cross-modal activation in the auditory cortex of two monkeys while they performed a demanding auditory categorization task: after a cue light was turned on, monkeys could initiate a tone sequence by touching a bar and then earn a reward by releasing the bar on occurrence of a falling frequency contour in the sequence. In their primary auditory cortex and posterior belt areas, we found many acoustically responsive neurons whose firing was synchronized to the cue light or to the touch or release of the bar. Of 315 multiunits, 45 exhibited cue light-related firing, 194 exhibited firing that was related to bar touch, and 268 exhibited firing that was related to bar release. Among 60 single units, we found one neuron with cue light-related firing, 21 with bar touch-related firing, and 36 with release-related firing. This firing disappeared at individual sites when the monkeys performed a visual detection task. Our findings corroborate and extend recent findings on cross-modal activation in the auditory cortex and suggests that the auditory cortex can be activated by visual and somatosensory stimulation and by movements. We speculate that the multimodal corepresentation in the auditory cortex has arisen from the intensive practice of the subjects with the behavioral procedure and that it facilitates the performance of audiomotor tasks in proficient subjects.

N2  - Objective: To analyze and discuss the deafness of Ludwig van Beethoven (1770-1827) and to offer a logical theory for its etiology. Method: The study will carefully review the composer's symptoms as described in his letters to friends and acquaintances and also will review a large body of source material, particularly publications by his contemporaries, some of which were generously loaned by Beethoven-haus, Bonn, Germany, where necessary translations were made directly from the original German. We will also study publications on Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) and its associated extraintestinal manifestations and personal discussions with experienced gastroenterologists. Results: Beethoven's abdominal symptoms that began in his teens are highly suggestive of IBD, which we believe to be a correct diagnosis. IBD is an umbrella term that includes a number of named entities such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's Disease. IBD is now considered to be a problem of immune regulation with extra intestinal manifestations that include sensorineural hearing loss and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). PSC eventually causes cirrhosis and failure of the liver. A diagnosis of IBD therefore provides a single entity that explains most of the composer's symptoms and was finally the cause of his death. Our conclusion is that Beethoven's sensorineural hearing loss was an immunopathy associated with IBD. © 2005, Otology & Neurotology, Inc.

N2  - Piano students working to improve technique often practice the same passage over and over to achieve accuracy, increase speed, or perfect interpretive nuance. However, without proper skeletal alignment of hands, arms, and shoulders and balance between the muscles involved, such repetition may lead to difficulties with, rather than mastery of, technique and stylistic interpretation and even physical injury. A variety of technologies have been developed to monitor skeletal alignment and muscle balance that serve to help students and teachers make needed corrections during performance by providing immediate biofeedback. This paper describes and illustrates a multimodal use of these biofeedback technologies and the powerful advantages of such a multimodal approach in making the student and teacher not only aware of improper alignments and balances in real time (or for later review) but also aware of approaches to correct them and improve musical outcome. The modalities consist of hearing playback through a Disklavier piano; simultaneous visual feedback displayed as a piano roll screen of what was played; video recording synchronized with the Disklavier and piano roll feedback; motion analysis of the arms, hands, and fingers; and electromyographic recordings of the muscle actions involved.

N2  - Classical musicians are often exposed to sound levels that exceed the Finnish national action limit value of 85 dB(A). Still, the use of hearing protectors is uncommon among musicians. The purpose of this study was to find out musician's attitudes towards hearing protectors, and under which conditions hearing protectors are used. The study group consisted of five major classical orchestras in the Helsinki region. The players were asked to fill out a questionnaire with questions on hearing protection, ear symptoms, including tinnitus, hearing loss, pain in the ears, and temporary ringing in the ears. Also, questions concerning stress and working environments were asked. Of those who responded, 94% were concerned about their hearing to some degree. Only 6% of the musicians always used hearing protector devices (HPDs). Selfreported hearing loss was quite common, with 31% of the musicians reporting some hearing loss. Temporary tinnitus was even more common at 37%. There were 15% of women, and 18% of men reporting permanent tinnitus. Hyper-acousis was reported by 43% of the musicians. The ear symptoms affected the usage rate. Hearing protectors were used more often among musicians having ear symptoms (20%) than those reporting no symptoms (6%). Further, the 43% of the musicians found their work to be interesting and meaningful. Stress was experienced to some extent by 60%, and musicians with ear symptoms had three to nine times more stress and felt their working environment noisier. The study shows that musicians seldom use hearing protectors before symptoms begin. Symptoms increased usage rate, but the usage levels are still far from ideal. Motivation and training is needed to improve hearing protector use among musicians.

N2  - To determine the difference in hearing between a group of steelband musicians (pannists) and a control group. We conducted a controlled cross-sectional pilot study consisting of 29 steelpan players and 30 control subjects from a steelpan orchestra (steelband) in the Otolaryngology Department of the Eric Williams Medical Sciences Complex. Significantly more steelpan players had a hearing loss than the control subjects at 3000 Hz, 4000 Hz, and 6000 Hz (P < 0.01). χ2 testing for trend demonstrated that the longer a steelpan player played his instrument the greater the hearing loss. These results indicate that pannists suffer permanent auditory damage from high-intensity sound levels and that preventative measures are required to prevent this hearing loss, particularly in younger players.

N2  - This study consisted of medical examination and comparison of results obtained in 70 musicians from the Slovene Philharmonic Orchestra, Ljubljana. The main goals of the study were to identify performance-related musculoskeletal disorders, to assess the health status and working capacity of the musicians, and to propose measures for improved protection of their health. The results were compared with results obtained in a control group of 28 marketing workers at Philip Morris Enterprise, Ljubljana. Musculoskeletal problems of the studied group of Slovene musicians were compared with problems of 109 musicians of the Berlin Opera Orchestra examined at the Institute of Occupational Health, Berlin, Germany. We identified performance-related diseases (inflammatory and degenerative skeletal disorders and minor occupational hearing impairments) that were most frequent. A significant proportion of performing musicians had overuse syndrome, caused by excessive use of the extremities and characterized by cumulative microtrauma exceeding human physiologic limits, and dermatologic problems, such as finger calluses and "fiddler's neck." The most frequent musculoskeletal problems were due to repetitive motion, unphysiologic postures (isometric strain on the affected muscles), and prolonged sitting position during performances. The highest level of musculoskeletal disorders was noted in the double bass and cello sections, followed by violin, viola, woodwind, and brass players. The severity of physical impairments and restricted ability to perform music were correlated with age, duration of classical music performance, and total length of service. In the group of Slovenian musicians, the incidence of health problems in general was twice as high as in the control group, whereas the incidence of musculoskeletal disorders was six times as high as that in the control group. Health status of the musicians in term's of moderate and severe physical impairments was worse than in the control group. Measures for improved health protection and better performance ability were proposed.

N2  - Hearing loss in a young adult can be devastating and prompt diagnosis and treatment of the cause are vital. This case report is of a young musician presenting to the ENT surgeons with deafness and a lower motor neurone facial nerve palsy which was given a presumptive diagnosis of infective pathology but subsequent investigations indicated this was an uncommon presentation of Wegener's Granulomatosis. Treatment involved systemic Cyclophosphamide followed by steroids and Azathioprine. Two years after commencing therapy the disease remains under control but the patient is left with bilateral hearing aids and a grade 3 facial nerve palsy. Diagnosis and treatment of this multi-system disease are discussed.

N2  - Playing a musical instrument involves the repetitive use of muscles, often at their extreme range of motion. Consequently, musicians in general are at an increased risk for the development of pain syndromes related to nerve or musculoskeletal damage. Acoustic and electric guitars are among the most popular instruments in the world today, with a large population of musicians at risk of injury. This article examines the results of a survey completed by 261 professional, amateur, and student guitarists to determine the most common anatomic locations of playing-related pain and its relationship to possible etiologic factors. A survey of 15 questions was distributed to professional, amateur, and student guitarists who play the musical genres of rock/blues, jazz, and folk across the United States and Canada. The questions addressed type of guitar played, style of music performed, playing posture, picking technique, anatomic location of pain, history of formal training, presence of playing-related pain in the past 12 months, history of trauma to the affected area, and history of other nonrelated medical problems. Playing-related pain was reported by 160 (61.3%) of 261 guitarists who completed the survey. The most often reported location was the fretting hand, with 109 (41.8%) of 261 subjects reporting the presence of playing-related pain in the previous 12 months. The back and neck were the next most reported sites of playing-related pain, with 45 (17.2%) of 261 subjects reporting back pain and 39 (14.9%) of 261 subjects reporting neck pain in the previous 12 months. The results suggest that a substantial number of guitarists playing various styles of popular music are experiencing playing-related pain.

N2  - Brass instrument players are exposed to unique health risks due to increased pharyngeal pressures necessary for performance. One such risk is development of laryngoceles, or "blowout" of the larynx. This cross-sectional observational study was performed to determine the pressure required to play different frequencies in a variety of brass instruments. The hypothesis tested was that enharmonic frequencies require the same pharyngeal pressure regardless of the instrument. The brass instruments tested were high-pressure, low-flow instruments (trumpet or French horn) or low-pressure, high-flow instruments (tuba or trombone). We were not able to substantiate Jacobs' theory that enharmonic frequencies resulted in equal pressures regardless of instrument, but we did elicit some high pressures in the hypopharynx when playing the trumpet or horn at higher frequencies.

N2  - A study on the assessment of hearing and hearing disorders in rock/jazz musicians concluded that 74% of the musicians had some kind of disorder. The main hearing disorders found were pure-tone hearing loss, tinnitus (an acoustic sensation of sounds), hyperacusis (a hypersensitivity to low or moderate sound levels), and distortion (music sounds out of tune). Affected musicians often were able to give the exact time of the first appearance of the hearing disorders, which often was associated with a period of excessive sound exposure, high workload, or some form of emotional stress. The aim of this study was to explore associations between psychosocial work conditions, mental load, and hearing disorders in rock/jazz musicians. A total of 139 (43 women and 96 men) voluntarily participating rock/jazz musicians answered a questionnaire on psychosocial work conditions and mental load. The data were correlated to hearing and sex. The median age was 35 years in the women and 37 years in the men. Results showed that rock/jazz musicians do not generally experience themselves as stressed at work. The influence of working conditions is good, and the work consists mainly of attractive tasks. In men, hyperacusis was associated with higher psychological demands, greater difficulty in relaxing after work, higher stress during individual preparation, not getting enough sleep, and higher perceived sound level. In women, tinnitus was associated with greater difficulty in relaxing after work and less energy during musical performances. No strong correlation between psychosocial parameters and hearing loss was found. Positive and negative effects of stress on hearing are discussed.

N2  - This article describes findings from two separate convenience samples of popular musicians' health status, access to and use of health care, health habits, and related attitudes surveyed in 1996-1997. Sample 1 consisted of 111 musicians attending one of three regional music conferences (in Portland, OR, Austin, TX, or San Francisco, CA). The findings from sample 1 consist of demographics and music career-related information; current medical problems; nonmusculoskeletal (N-MS) and musculoskeletal (MS) problems that affected performance in the previous year; access to and use of health care; health habits related to alcohol, drug use, and smoking, use of hearing protection; and several health-related attitudes. Sample 2 consisted of 115 musicians surveyed in 1996 by mail from a random sample of a musicians' union list, by face-to-face interview during music club jobs in Dallas, Texas, or at a music conference in New Orleans, Louisiana. The findings from sample 2 are generally limited to N-MS and MS problems that affected performance in the previous year, health habits, and some health-related attitudes. Basic findings for sample 1 were as follows: 26% cited a current medical problem, 49% had at least one N-MS problem, 74% had at least one MS problem, and 42% reported hearing loss. In sample 2, 37% of the musicians reported hearing loss. Overall percentages for N-MS and MS problems for sample 2 were not available, but percentages for specific problems are delineated. Depression and anxiety were among the most frequently cited N-MS problems for both samples. Pain and stiffness were the most frequently reported MS problems for both samples. Ten percent of sample 1 musicians and 16% of sample 2 musicians indicated that alcohol or drug use had hurt their performance in the previous year. More than half of the musicians in sample 1 and sample 2 had health insurance, but most obtained it through non-music-related jobs or family coverage. Although the generalizability of the findings is limited significantly by the nonrandom nature of the samples and generally low response rates, this study nonetheless contributes provisional information on popular musicians' health status. The findings are compared with other musician samples where possible, including some previously unpublished health findings from the University of North Texas Musicians' Health Survey on the Internet. Specific concerns and strategies for future research on popular musicians' health status are suggested.

N2  - The aim of this study was to assess hearing and hearing disorders among rock/jazz musicians. One hundred and thirty-nine (43 women and 96 men) musicians participated. The results are based on pure-tone audiometry and questionnaire responses. According to our definition of hearing loss, tinnitus, hyperacusis, distortion and/ or diplacusis as hearing disorders, we found disorders in 74% of the rock/jazz musicians studied. Hearing loss, tinnitus and hyperacusis were most common, and the latter two were found significantly more frequently than in different reference populations. The women showed bilateral, significantly better hearing thresholds at 3-6 kHz than the men. Hyperacusis, and the combination of both hyperacusis and tinnitus, were found to be significantly more frequent among women than among men. Hearing loss and tinnitus were significantly more common among men than among women. It is important to evaluate all kinds of hearing problems (other than hearing loss) in musicians, since they represent an occupational group especially dependent on optimal, functional hearing. On the basis of our results, we suggest that hearing problems such as tinnitus, hyperacusis, distortion and/ or diplacusis should, in addition to hearing loss, be defined as hearing disorders.

N2  - The purpose of the study was to determine how and when the personnel of the Finnish National Opera are exposed to noise and whether exposure depends on musical selection of repertoire. Additionally, an evaluation of sound exposure level due to individual rehearsals was included. The measurements were done using individual noise dosimeters and fixed-point measurements. From the measurements, annual noise exposure in the Opera was evaluated. The conductors, dancers, and double bass players were exposed to levels below 85 decibels, A-weighted, dB(A), which is the national action level. The choir members were exposed to sound levels of 92 and 94 dB(A). Within the orchestra, the highest sound exposure levels were found among percussionists, 95 dB(A); flute/piccolo players, 95 dB(A); and brass players, 92-94 dB(A). Other sound exposure levels among orchestra members varied from 83 to 89 dB(A). Soloists and rehearsal pianists are likely to be exposed to sound levels exceeding the national action level. From an exposure perspective, the individual rehearsals, 79-100 dB(A), proved to be as important as performances and group rehearsals, 82-99 dB(A), among orchestra musicians and choir singers. The ambient sound level for the lighting crew was 76 ± 4 dB(A). However, the measured sound levels at the ear varied from 77 to 92 dB(A) due to the communication via headphones that had individual volume control. For the majority of personnel of the Finnish National Opera, sound exposure level exceeded the national action level value of 85 dB(A). Artists exceeded the action level during both individual and group rehearsals, as well as during performances. Hearing protection has been designed for musicians. Education/reinforcement is required to ensure it is worn.

N2  - Aim: The present study aimed at measuring the sound pressure levels to which carnival musicians are exposed, especially those who play frevo and maracatu rhythms. We also investigated musicians' minimum auditory levels, learned, their complaints, habits and hearing difficulties and compared the results between frevo and maracatu groups in order to gather data for the implementation of a Hearing Conservation Program directed to counsel professions about auditory risks of exposure to music. Study design: Clinical prospective randomized. Material and method: Our sample consisted of 19 frevo musicians and 31 maracatu musicians, aged between 12 and 71 years. We used a questionnaire to learn about musicians' correlated complaints and habits. The minimum auditory levels were measured. Results: The main complaints were dizziness and tinnitus, and the most frequent habits were going out to discos and wearing walkman. Audiometric configuration in frevo group showed 42.10% of audiometric curves suggesting NIHL, whereas in maracatu group the frequency was 16.13%. In frevo group, age, time span of the career and time of exposure to music influenced the occurrence of auditory abnormalities. Conclusions: We concluded that it is necessary to implement a Hearing Conservation Program to this population of musicians, owing mainly to their poor awareness of risks associated with onset of hearing loss as a result of exposure to music at high sound pressure levels.

N2  - Tinnitus is a common and potentially disabling problem that is commonly associated with hearing loss. The loss of hearing may occur as a consequence of cochlear damage or other injury to the inner ear. Recent research suggests that tinnitus may be due to spontaneous neural activity in central auditory pathways. These pathways appear to be altered as the consequence of deafferentation. These aberrant pathways may also link the auditory system with other elements of the central nervous system. Since the treatment for tinnitus is largely unsatisfactory, preventing tinnitus by adopting measures designed to preserve hearing is appropriate and prudent. The prevention of hearing loss is an important goal for everyone, particularly musicians.

N2  - Using pure tone audiometry in 1995, a hearing reassessment was made in 56 classical musicians who participated in Axelsson & Lindgren's study 16 years earlier, in 1979. This study focuses on hearing development in these classical orchestra musicians, active in Göteborg, Sweden. The aim of the study is to evaluate the risk of progressive hearing loss during work in a classical orchestra. Another aim is to study possible hearing differences in females and males and to compare the high frequency pure-tone average values found in the study with two normal materials. The main findings were that the male, compared to the female musicians, showed a tendency toward a more pronounced, although not significant, hearing reduction in the high frequency region and higher threshold distribution within the 90th percentile than the females. This was found most often in the left ear. The median audiogram for all females showed a notch configuration at 6 kHz, compared to the males who had a high-tone sloping configuration. When comparing high frequency pure-tone average (HFPTA) values with ISO 7029, the females are distributed around the ISO 7029 median and well within the 90th percentile. The average among the males was equal with the median. Comparison with Davis normal population "all the sample, overall occupational group" showed a more even distribution of the HFPTA values around the median for both females and males on both occasions. This follow-up study showed no extended negative progress of the pure-tone hearing threshold values in spite of an additional 16 years of musical noise exposure.

N2  - Pure-tone audiometry was performed on 140 classical orchestral musicians employed at the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra and the Gothenburg Opera in Sweden. This report is based on the results from heating threshold measurements, presented as median audio-grams according to gender, age group and instrument group. The results did not show severe heating losses that could be attributed to exposure to musical noise. However, the study reflects the subjects' present hearing ability status and does not give an answer to the question of future hearing dysfunction. Female musicians were shown to have significantly better heating thresholds in the high-frequency area than did male musicians. Furthermore, the median pure-tone heating thresholds for the male musicians displayed a notch configuration at 6 kHz in the left ear, similar that of to noise-induced hearing loss. A small, but in general not significant, difference was detected when comparing the median hearing thresholds between each instrument group. Percussion and woodwind players displayed slightly worse hearing thresholds than did other musicians. Players of large string instruments had the best hearing threshold values. When comparing age groups and gender it was noted that the median hearing thresholds were stable and within 20 dB HL up to the age group of 40-49 years for both females and males.

N2  - We investigated the ability to perform solfeggio, i.e. oral reading of musical notes in MP, a 65 year-old female professional musician, who, following a left temporoparietal ischemia, showed a complex pattern of amusia. The deficit on which we focused was her inability to read orally the bass (F) clef, often substituting it with the violin (G) clef. This problem could not be attributed to a lack of comprehension. The patient could in fact correctly perform on the piano the same sequences she erroneously read aloud; she was also able to correctly judge whether two strings, one in bass clef and the other in violin clef, represented the same sequence of notes. The problem seems to lie in the inability to retrieve note names keeping into account the clef-rule. It is hypothesized that, in the production of note names, this function requires the identification and application of syntactic-like information, in analogy with what is thought to happen in the retrieval of other words.

N2  - Aim: Professional orchestral musicians are exposed to sound levels which can potentially lead to hearing impairment. The aim of this study was to examine if personally adapted earplugs with integrated filters which uniformly reduce the sound level over a wide frequency range (ER-15) might help to avoid temporary threshold shifts (TTS) and thus probably permanent threshold shifts (PTS). Secondly, we investigated whether these earplugs are acceptable to the musicians. Method and Collective: 40 of the 127 members of the 'Philharmonisches Staatsorchester Hamburg' participated in this study. 6 of the musicians, all brass and woodwind players, ended their participation because of difficulties in playing when wearing ER-15 earplugs. Pure-tone audiometry was carried out to determine air conduction (0.25-8 kHz) 11 minutes (mean) after playing with and without earplugs during opera performances (i.e. two audiometric tests per member). Furthermore we drew up audiograms for air and bone conduction before the first performances, and the participants filled in a questionnaire about the suitability of the earplugs. During the opera performances equivalent continuous sound levels (Leq dB(A)) were measured at each musician's place. Results: On average the hearing levels for bone conduction did not exceed the normal loss of hearing with age. Equivalent sound level values from 83.0 to 94.1 dB(A) were found depending on the opera and instrument. Peak sound levels reached 97 to 112 dB(A). The equivalent sound levels of brass and woodwind players were 4 dB(A) higher than those of the strings. Most of the musicians declared they had considerable difficulties in playing their instruments and playing with the orchestra. After playing without earplugs more distinct differences in the hearing threshold were found than after a performance with earplugs. The difference in the hearing levels exceeded 3 dB at 4 kHz on the right and 4 to 6 kHz on the left (p each < 0.001). Conclusions: The results of the audiometric tests prove the effectiveness of the earplugs. Nevertheless, the questionnaires revealed that they cause considerable limitations for the musicians' professional work, especially for brass and woodwind players. Earplugs therefore cannot be recommended in general during performances, but should be made available on demand for orchestral musicians.

N2  - Like any individuals who are subjected to excessive noise exposure, musicians can suffer a hearing loss. It does not matter if the ″noise″ to which they are subjected is classical music - the human ear cannot tell the difference. Hearing loss can present difficult social problems for anyone but the situation is worse for professional musicians as ″listening″ is part of their livelihood. Once damage is done to the ear, it cannot be undone. Therefore, the question of how the damage can be prevented needs to be answered. This article details actions taken by Symphony Australia to reduce potentially damaging noise injury to musicians through the use of specifically developed barriers or ″shields″. The project was a combined effort by Symphony Australia, the ABC, the National Acoustic Laboratories and the University of Technology, Sydney.

N2  - A case of pure amusia in a 20 year old left handed non-professional musician is reported. The patient showed an impairment of music abilities in the presence of normal processing of speech and environmental sounds. Furthermore, whereas recognition and production of melodic sequences were grossly disturbed, both the recognition and production of rhythm patterns were preserved. This selective breakdown pattern was produced by a focal lesion in the left superior temporal gyrus. This case thus suggests that not only linguistic and musical skills, but also melodic and rhythmic processing are independent of each other. This functional dissociation in the musical domain supports the hypothesis that music components have a modular organisation. Furthermore, there is the suggestion that amusia may be produced by a lesion located strictly in one hemisphere and that the superior temporal gyrus plays a crucial part in melodic processing.

N2  - The potential for reorganization in the adult brain has been largely underestimated in the past and we are just beginning to understand the organisational principles involved in functional recovery. A bulk of experimental evidences have been accumulated in support of the hypothesis that neuronal aggregates adjacent to a lesion in the cortical brain areas can be progressively vicarious to the function of the damaged neurones. Such a reorganisation, if occurring in the affected hemisphere of a patient with a monohemispheric lesion, should significantly modify the interhemispheric symmetry of somatotopic organisation of the sensorimotor cortices, both in terms of absolute surfaces and number of 'recruited' neurons, as well as of spatial coordinates. In fact, a roughly symmetrical organisation of sensorimotor - particularly for the hand contorl - in the right and left hemisphere has been observed in healthy humans by different methods of functional brain imaging, including fMRI, TMS, MEG, HD-EEG. Not uniform results about the functional brain activity related to sensory, motor and cognitive functions in normal and diseased subjects are often due to differences in the experimental paradigm designed as well as in the spatial and temporal resolution of the neuroimaging techniques used. The multi-modal integration of data obtained with several neuroimaging techniques allowed a coherent modelling of human brain higher functions. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provided fine spatial details (millimetres) of the brain responses, which were compared with the cortical maps of the motor output to different body districts obtained with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Magnetoencephalography (MEG) ability to study sensorimotor areas by analysing cortical magnetic fields, is also complementary to the motor cortex topographical mapping provided by TMS. MEG high temporal resolution allows to detect relatively restricted functional neuronal pools activated during cerebral processing of external stimuli. Moreover, these brain responses can be investigated with magnetoencephalography (MEG) and high density electroencephalography (EEG) techniques, with elevated time resolution (ms). With respect to the high resolution EEG technique, the MEG technique allowed a more precise localisation of the sites of neural activity buried into the cortical sulci, but was unable to detect the response of the crown of the cortical giri and of the frontal-mesial cortex (including the supplementary motor area), because of its poor sensitivity to radially oriented dipoles. The integration of functional and anatomical information provide cues on the relationship between brain activity and anatomic sites where this takes place, allowing the characterisation of the physiological activity of the cortical brain layers as well as to study the plastic reorganisation of the brain in different pathological conditions following stroke, limb amputation, spinal cord injury, hemisperectomy.

N2  - A 52-year-old male was evaluated by the authors after initially reporting fullness in his left ear while traveling on an airplane. A unique feature of the patient's complaint was the development of severe bilateral hyperacusis (loudness discomfort levels of between 20-34 dB HL) in spite of the fact that the hearing loss was initially reported in the left ear. To achieve loudness comfort, the patient was initially fit with ER-25 musician earplugs that proved to be unsuccessful. The patient next purchased earplugs and earmuffs from a gun shop in order to obtain relief from the pain and discomfort caused by his exposure to everyday environmental sounds. This paper describes the use of hearing devices that proved to be effective in providing attenuation sufficient that the patient rarely needs to rely on earplugs and earmuffs for relief from his hyperacusis.

N2  - Jazz education plays a prominent role in the music education of students in secondary and postsecondary schools. Although there is some research relative to health risks posed to professional musicians, little information is available as it relates to young musicians at the collegiate and secondary levels. The primary purpose of this study was to assess the risk of music- induced hearing loss to members of a college jazz band using the currently defined damage risk criteria of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)(1983). Dosimeter measurements were made over a three- day period for five different positions within a University of North Texas jazz ensemble. Measurements obtained from each musician and each position were then compared with current OSHA standards. Findings indicated that when equivalent measures were derived for three hours of exposure, allowable exposure limits were exceeded for ten of the 15 measures obtained. The lead musicians within the ensemble appeared to be at the highest risk for hearing loss. The findings lend further support for the inclusion of musicians in an occupational noise standard.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to examine the incidence of hearing problems reported from a heterogeneous group of musicians as a function of both primary performance area and primary instrument. Information for the investigation was obtained from the University of North Texas Musician Health Survey that allows musicians to report medical problems via the World Wide Web. Data were generated from a question regarding the presence or absence of hearing loss. The respondents were grouped according to primary performance area, according to primary instrument, and by primary instrument relative to whether they were classical or nonclassical musicians. Results showed that 21.7% of the 3,292 musicians responding perceived having a problem with hearing. Findings showed the highest rate of occurrence was in rock/alternative musicians; in musicians who were included in the nonclassical grouping; and in musicians who played amplified instruments, drum-set, and primary brass instruments. Implications for further research and risk management are discussed.

N2  - Sound level measurements were conducted 17 times in the orchestra pits of 14 different Broadway shows in response to musicians' complaints to Local 802, American Federation of Musicians. The Broadway shows studied had orchestras ranging from 17 to 29 musicians who played a variety of instruments, including wind, brass, percussion, string, and electric instruments. There were 13 (76%) performances with sound levels above those recommended by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) for a four-hour time period, and ten (59%) for performances with sound levels above those recommended by NIOSH for a two-hour time period. Two shows exceeded the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) action level for two-hour exposure, and three shows exceeded the OSHA ceiling level. Safety precautions and recommendations included the adoption of a hearing conservation program including hearing screening, training and education, and free personal protective equipment. Site-specific recommendations included acoustical padding, baffles, reduction of the volume of the mix, changes in seating in the orchestra pit, and the use of personal protective equipment.

N2  - Purpose: The objective of our study is to evaluate the hearing and the hearing disturbs in musicians of the Sao Paulo Municipal Symphony Orchestra. Material and Methods: During rehersals were made sound measurements in the local, ranging from 81.4 to 94.7 dBSLP. The exposure period is around 8 to 10 daily hours of rehersals. The authors applied a questionary to 16 musicians and made hearing evaluation using conventional audiometry and otoacoustic emissions. Six (38%) of the musicians showed hearing loss compatible with noise-induced hearing loss through analysis of the results from audiometry and, from the 16 musicians, eleven (69%) had absent otoacoustic emissions to high frequencies. Results: There was more alteration in the otoacoustic emission than in the audiometry. Hearing disturbs like tinnitus and loud sound intolerance, present in ten musicians, can exist even without alteration in the exams. Conclusion: These results allow us to alert the professionals in relation to the hearing risks of exposition to very loud music and orientate them about a hearing conservation program.

N2  - Background: Hearing loss resulting from exposure to permanent or repeated amplified music in professional musicians and music consumers is described in literature. The risk of hearing loss does not exist only after prolonged exposure to music. Short-term exposure to very high sound levels, for example in concerts, can also cause hearing loss and tinnitus. Patients: The retrospective study includes 24 patients who required rheologic therapy between 1994 and 1997 due to a music related acoustic trauma. The type, intensity, and length of music exposure as well as the distance and the position to the source of noise were examined. The type of hearing damage and its development during theological treatment was studied by pure-tone audiometry. Results: In the majority of examined patients (67%) the hearing loss developed on the basis of one-time exposure at a rock concert or pop concert, followed by hearing loss from attending discotheques (17%) or parties (12%), and music exposure from personal cassette players (4%). The majority of patients showed a maximum hearing loss of 40-60 dB (A) in a frequency between 3 kHz and 4 kHz. Pure-tone audiometry in 58% of the patients exhibited a unilateral threshold in a frequency between 3 kHz and 4 kHz combined with ipsilateral tinnitus of the same frequency. Twenty-one percent of the patients showed a symmetric bilateral threshold and tinnitus between 3 kHz and 4 kHz. In 8% there was a unilateral tinnitus, and in 13% a bilateral tinnitus without any hearing loss. All patients improved their hearing loss during rheologic treatment. Improvement in the tinnitus was only achieved in 33% of the examined cases. Conclusion: The risk of permanent hearing loss resulting from short-term exposure to amplified music is low compared to the risk of continuous tinnitus. Given the lack of acceptance of personal ear protectors, the risk of acute hearing damage due to amplified music could be reduced by avoiding the immediate proximity to the speakers.

N2  - The purpose of the present study was to examine the effects of ear canal resonance on the spectral characteristics of sounds produced by musicians' instruments in relation to risk factors associated with noise-induced hearing loss. Nine musicians, each playing a different instrument, were chosen as subjects for the investigation. The spectrum levels of sounds produced by musical instruments were measured both inside and outside of the ear canal during performances of sustained Gs, paired at constant intensity levels and for three different octaves. With direct reference to the measured peak resonance of the musician's ear canal, comparisons were made between sound pressure levels inside the ear canal and sound pressure levels outside the ear canal. It was found that ear canal resonance has the potential to generate an increase in the sound pressure levels inside the ear canal of the performing musician by as much as 30 dB SPL. The implications for increased risk for hearing loss as a function of the interaction between ear canal resonance and the frequency spectrum of specific instruments are discussed.

N2  - In an anonymous survey a questionaire was sent to all university professors of the state of Hessen, asking for information related to ear and hearing, with special emphasis on tinnitus and sudden hearing loss. We received 1.005 answers, a rate of about 57%. This information was compared to and supplemented by data that were collected by the Division during various other actions. These data are related to 16 and 18 year old students, recruits of the German military, male and female university students of the University of Giessen, civil airline pilots, and musicians from classical orchestras. All told, data from 3.829 persons are included. 5% of the professors suffered from sudden hearing loss, 1.2% had permanently tinnitus, and 22% experienced an acute acoustic trauma. Interestingly, professors do not suffer very much from their tinnitus. As expected, tinnitus and sudden hearing loss increases with age, and professors are the group with the highest incidence. Airline pilots, on the other hand, have a low incidence, of tinnitus, but it is again relatively high in recruits of the military. The results are compared and discussed, and it is apparent that studying more or less homogeneous groups in a comparable way results in special insights.

N2  - Physiologic changes that occur in the auditory mechanism, as a function of aging and noise exposure, are well documented. However, it is difficult to determine the specific effects of aging without consideration of noise exposure. For younger people, the exposure to loud noise is the dominant factor for hearing loss, but as age increases, the effects of noise are not as evident. There is little known about how aging affects musicians' hearing. Using the NHIS population data, it is assumed that musicians would have similar patterns, but would be further impacted by the long-term effects of exposure to typical sound levels generated during music performance. Preliminary data from the UNT-MHS survey suggest that musicians may have a higher incidence of reported hearing loss up to the fourth decade of life compared with NHIS data. However, the UNT-MHS data suggest that musicians beyond the fourth decade report fewer problems with hearing loss compared with NHIS data. A possible explanation is that musicians evolve a higher level of auditory sensitivity and therefore are less likely to report noticeable changes to hearing. Overall, it must be noted that research regarding musicians' hearing loss and the effects of hearing problems, due to aging or other factors, is limited. On one hand, there are resources to aid in the understanding of these issues from the fields of audiology, psychology, and psychoacoustics. On the other hand, care is required to recognize the unique concerns of the musicians population. For instance, there is perhaps no other vocational group that requires the levels of auditory processing needed for the production of music. This challenges the current paradigm to protect occupational-related hearing loss. Unlike other occupations, the protection of hearing should not be the final goal. The goals for the musician must advance methods to protect while allowing for the hearing system to utilized maximally during work.

N2  - As part of their occupational health and safety program, the hearing of members of a Sydney orchestra was tracked over a period of five years, using both air conduction pure tone audiometry and click-evoked otoacoustic emissions. All pure tone audiometry was carried out by the WorkCover Authority of New South Wales at frequencies of 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8 kHz. Click-evoked otoacoustic emissions with 260 repetitions of the pulsed click train were recorded by the authors at a stimulus screening level of 80 (±1.5) dB peak SPL. Results have been analysed on an individual, instrumental section and whole orchestra basis. Group hearing levels (whole orchestra) as a result of pure tone audiometric testing have not declined significantly, although there are significant differences between sections. Results of otoacoustic emission testing are described in terms of the Otodynamics Analyser parameter called 'WAVEREPRO%'. When analysed on a section or whole orchestra basis these have not declined significantly either. Within sections, however, there is considerable variation between individuals and a number of musicians have a significant decline in otoacoustic emissions without a comparable decline in pure tone audiometry. Ears with low WAVEREPRO% and greater changes over time were seen from players seated in front of the brass section in particular. These changes over time are discussed in regard to test/retest variations.

N2  - The noise load of an orchestra musician depends on several factors. An evaluation of literature shows that orchestra musicians are regularly exposed to sound levels that are likely to cause hearing loss. The results of audiometric studies carried out in orchestra musicians, with special regard to occupation-related hearing impairments have been contradictory. These contradictions are mainly of methodic nature. It is very likely that the noise-load received by an orchestra musician - at least in some cases - is the cause of considerable hearing loss. Apart from the kind and intensity of the sound volume, the individual's sensitivity to noise also seems to play an important part. Since an intact sense of hearing is of vital interest for musicians, it is proposed to classify the workplace 'orchestra' as an area with a high-noise level and to apply the existing preventive measures against hearing impairments providing appropriate hearing protection devices and regular preventive occupational health surveys. However, the audiometric examinations carried out in musicians, should not be assessed by means of reference values developed with regard to avoiding any impairment of speech audition. The emphasis should rather be laid on individual follow-ups. Only the early detection of permanent hearing impairment makes it possible to prevent hearing deterioration from further at an early stage.

N2  - Although health problems in musicians have been previously reported, not much is known about noise-induced hearing loss due to choir singing. However, there are data to show that peak levels of more than 110 dB SPL are produced in choir singing, and major parts of sound energy can be found below 1 kHz and even 500 Hz but not below 100 Hz. To find out about possible hearing loss due to professional choir singing, we measured the hearing threshold level of 62 choir singers in a large opera choir. Most publications about noise-induced hearing loss report that the high-frequency region is impaired most. However, in our study the low frequency region was affected most, when compared with normative data (especially ISO 7029). Control groups of women and men with normal auditory function did not show pure-tone hearing thresholds different from ISO 7029. The permanent threshold shifts at 250 Hz and above are most likely noise induced with choir singing as noise source. However, hearing losses at 125 Hz and possibly partial at 250 Hz are caused by some other effect. An (unproven) hypothesis is that singing might lead to increased endolymph pressure, and thus might cause hearing loss especially in the low-frequency region. Whether more choirs show similar hearing impairment and whether singing raises cerebrospinal fluid pressure will be the subject of further investigations.

N2  - This paper focuses on the auditive and extra-auditive effects of noise in relation to musicians. Although much is known about hearing damage caused by high noise levels among industrial workers, less is understood about the influence of noise on hearing, the cardiovascular system, cardiovascular risk factors, and their interaction with stress factors on musicians. This study, part of a larger ongoing project (CORDIS), comprised journal and computerized scanning of relevant material; and interviews with musicians, researchers, and medical, engineering, and other specialists. There is a need for more research in musicians' health problems and the development of suitable prevention measures.

N2  - Background: A case of a professional violinist suffering from a bilateral tinnitus is presented. The musician reported the tinnitus to be louder and more straining when playing his Vuillaume violin (France 1840) as compared with his Carcassi violin (Italy 1763). Case report: In the 42-year-old musician, audiometry revealed a normal hearing threshold in the right ear and a slight hearing loss in the left ear of up to 20 dB between 2 kHz and 8 kHz. Transitory evoked otoacoustic emissions could only be measured in the right ear. The tinnitus could be masked (distance type); residual inhibition was only seen in the right ear. By sound intensity measurements in both external auditory canals, the different sound spectra of both violins could be demonstrated. When playing with 'forte' intensity, sound pressure reached peaks of over 90 dB. The tinnitus was ameliorated by lidocaine infusions. Discussion and conclusions: The different sound spectra of both violins may be the reason for the enhancement of the musician's tinnitus. Interference of air and bone-conducted sound could lead to a cochlear overlap and thus influence the tinnitus although such a phenomenon can not be verified. It was previously reported that high-pitched instruments may cause tinnitus sensations in performing musicians. A review of the literature surprisingly reveals that although professional musicians are exposed to sound pressure levels that may cause hearing impairment, only very few do develop one. This fact has to be taken into account whenever an occupational disease is suspected.

N2  - The aim of this experiment was to describe the hearing effects in musicians of a Brazilian 'Trio Eletrico', compared to symphonic orchestra and rock musicians. The population was constituted of 21 musicians, ranged from 15 to 45 years old, who were submitted to anamnesis and minimum audible level for pure tones in a silent environment, before and after performance. The sound pressure levels at the vehicle were measured. The results have shown these levels not to be different between the three groups, but 100% of the 'Trio Eletrico' musicians presented TTS from 10 to 35 dBHL and tinnitus (76%). The conclusions outline the importance hearing conservation program for musicians and improve the awareness for these professionals toward the risks of excessively amplified music for their hearing.

N2  - In 1975, the threshold hearing levels (HLs) of 83 Swedish and British pop/rock musicians were examined with pure tone audiometry. At that time we found 13% of the musicians with a hearing loss > 20 dB HL at a high frequency pure tone average (3, 4, 6, and 8 kHz). The aim of the present investigation was to conduct an audiometric follow-up study of these musicians 16 years after the first examination. Fifty-three of the 83 pop/rock musicians were retested in 1991 to 1992. They also filled in a questionnaire concerning occupational noise activities, leisure noise activities, general health problems and subjective symptoms related to loud music exposure. The median pure tone audiogram was within 20 dB HL at all test frequencies. On an individual basis, 63% had normal high frequency pure tone average scores and another 15% had a very limited high frequency hearing loss (≤25 dB HL). It seems surprising that pop/rock musicians after performing for 26 years have such well-preserved hearing. There might be a protective effect by the generally positive attitude from the musicians toward their performance and their audience. Regarding the loud and more or less continuous sound levels over 85 dBA there might also be a protective effect from a continuous contraction of the stapedius muscle.

N2  - Hearing losses resulting from noise exposure have been described for over 150 years. Studies looking at the effect music might have on hearing began more recently in the 1960s. Such work has established a firm association between live rock and roll music and hearing loss in musicians. However, the evidence that classical music may damage the hearing of musicians remains conflicting. This paper reviews the published literature.

N2  - We tend not to think of music as noise but as a pleasant sound. Yet, played loud enough, music can become a threat to the human ear. The question arises whether professional musicians suffer from hearing losses caused by their playing of music. The hearing of students at the Rotterdam conservatory was studied; medical students served as a reference group. High percentages of audiometric noise dips (16%) and high-frequency losses (20%) were found in students of the conservatory, as well as a high percentage (72%) of extended high-frequency losses relative to the reference curves of Dreschler et al. Surprisingly, an equally large (and in the high-frequency region an even higher) percentage of hearing losses was found in the control group of medical students with the same median age. In sum, the exposure of conservatory students to the practice of music has as yet had no effect on their hearing.

N2  - The incidence of hearing impairment in musicians of Chinese opera is higher than that in popular music and rock and roll music. The sound levels of different instruments used in Chinese opera measured acoustically showed drums, gongs and cymbols to be hazardous to the ear. The conventional measures of prevention, such as ear plugs are not acceptable by the musicians because of interference to the musician's hearing ability. A rearrangement of situations of the musicians was suggested by the authors. The percussive musicians should be situated one meter lower than other musicians. Animal (guinea pigs) experiments by study of AP in EcochG and ultrastructural observations of the cochlea have confirmed that our suggestion for prevention of noise induced hearing impairment to be efficient.

N2  - Recent studies have investigated the structure of perceptual relations among musical instrument timbres by multidimensional scaling (MDS) techniques. These studies have employed both acoustically produced tones and digitally synthesized imitations and hybrids of acoustic instrument tones. The analyses of dissimilarity ratings for all pairs of a set of tones are usually represented as geometrical structures in a two- or three-dimensional Euclidean space in which the shared 'perceptual' axes are shown to have a qualitative correspondence to acoustic properties such as spectral energy distribution, onset characteristics and degree of change in spectral distribution over the duration of the tone. The present study took as a point of departure a MDS analysis for complex, synthetic tones with the aim of testing whether musician and non-musician listeners used the relations defined by the perceptual space to perform an analogies task of the sort: timbre A is to timbre B as timbre C is to which of two possible timbres, D or D'? A parallelogram model was used to select the D timbres: if the relation between A and B is represented as a vector with both magnitude and direction components, then the appropriate D should form a vector with C having similar magnitude and direction in the timbre space. Aside from conceptual difficulties with the task for both non-musicians and composers, choices for both groups provide support for the parallelogram model indicating a capacity in listeners to perceive abstract relations among the timbres of complex sounds without specific training in such a task.

N2  - Objectives - To test the hypothesis that noise exposure may cause hearing loss in classical musicians. Design - Comparison of hearing levels between two risk groups identified during the study by measuring sound levels. Setting - Symphony orchestra and occupational health department in the west Midlands. Main outcome measures - Hearing level as measured by clinical pure tone audiometry. Results - Trumpet and piccolo players received a noise dose of 160% and 124%, respectively, over mean levels during part of the study. Comparison of the hearing levels of 18 woodwind and brass musicians with 18 string musicians matched for age and sex did not show a significant difference in hearing, the mean difference in the hearing levels at the high (2, 4, and 8 KHz) audiometric frequencies being 1.02 dB (95% confidence interval -2.39 to 4.43). Conclusions - This study showed that there is a potential for occupational hearing loss in classical orchestral musicians.

N2  - To assess the risk of noise-induced hearing loss among musicians in the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, personal dosimeters set to the 3-dB exchange rate were used to obtain 68 noise exposure measurements during rehearsals and concerts. The musicians' L(eq) values ranged from 79-99 dB A-weighted sound pressure level [dB(A)], with a mean of 89.9 dB(A). Based on 15 h of on-the-job exposure per week, the corresponding 8-h daily L(eq) (excluding off-the-job practice and playing) ranged from 75-95 dB(A) with a mean of 85.5 dB(A). Mean hearing threshold levels (HTLs) for 59 musicians were better than those for an unscreened nonindustrial noise-exposed population (NINEP), and only slightly worse than the 0.50 fractile data for the ISO 7029 (1984) screened presbycusis population. However, 52.5% of individual musicians showed notched audiograms consistent with noise-induced hearing damage. Violinists and violists showed significantly poorer thresholds at 3-6 kHz in the left ear than in the right ear, consistent with the left ear's greater exposure from their instruments. After HTLs were corrected for age and sex, HTLs were found to be significantly better for both ears of musicians playing bass, cello, harp, or piano and for the right ears of violinists and violists than for their left ears or for both ears of other musicians. For 32 musicians for whom both HTLs and L(eq) were obtained, HTLs at 3-6 kHz were found to be correlated with the L(eq) measured.

N2  - Hearing is of special vocational importance in musicians. Musical performance may create sounds sufficiently intense to cause sensorineural hearing loss. Although such losses are usually not severe enough to be compensable under American Academy of Otolaryngology guidelines for occupational hearing loss, they may interfere with the musician's ability to perform the daily tasks of his or her profession. A review of the literature on occupational hearing loss in musicians reveals a substantial need for further research.

N2  - The hearing loss of Ludwig von Beethoven has fascinated physicians, audiologists, and musicologists for almost 200 years. In this review of the literature, the features, treatment, and differential diagnosis of the composer's malady are discussed. An original series of hypothetical audiograms and actual photomicrographs depicting cochlear otosclerosis and Paget's disease are also provided. The author concludes with the majority of otologists that cochlear otosclerosis is the most likely diagnosis for the hearing loss. In addition, a summary of Beethoven's complicated medical history and results of the autopsy that confirmed chronic liver disease are included.

N2  - Symphony orchestra musicians from The Royal Danish Theathre (15 females and 80 males) aged 22 to 64 years were audiologically examined to elucidate the presence and the frequency of noise-induced hearing loss among classical musicians. Compared to a reference material (ISO 7029) the median hearing thresholds of the musicians were increased for all age groups. When using hearing sensitivity in one or both ears <20 dB HL as a criterion for normality, it was found that 58% of the musicians had a hearing impairment. 50% of the males and 13% of the females showed a typical audiogram with a notched curve at higher frequencies normally attributed to occupational noise exposure. Furthermore, a significantly poorer hearing on the left ear was found at higher frequencies among the violinists. It is concluded that symphonic musicians suffer from hearing impairment and that the impairment might be ascribed to symphonic music.

N2  - Sixty members of the Minnesota Orchestra (aged 24 to 64 years) and 30 nonmusicians (aged 20 to 69 years) were evaluated for hearing sensitivity within the conventional audiometric range (0.25 to 8 kHz) and within the extended high frequency audiometric range (9 to 20 kHz). Threshold data were evaluated by age, sex, and musician-nonmusician categories for the respective frequencies, and data were compared to other studies. Musician hearing appeared no poorer than nonmusician hearing, suggesting no major hearing loss from musicians' exposure to orchestral noise. Hearing acuity of the two groups was similar to some normal groups reported in the world literature but appeared poorer in comparison to some normal groups defined by a very restrictive definition of normal hearing. Issues relating to the definition of normal hearing are explored. A mathematical model descriptive of extended high tone hearing sensitivity for musicians and nonmusicians evaluated was calculated. The formula is presented from which typical age-specific extended high frequency thresholds may be calculated for the 90 subjects evaluated.

N2  - The damaging effect of high noise levels is well-known. As there are also high noise levels in orchestras, it has to be examined whether those effects are possibly within the acoustic trauma hazard range and which consequences this may have for the musicians. The sound pressure levels were measured and recorded continuously in the orchestra pit during 21 performances of 12 different operas. Additionally, noise-dosimetry was carried out on 30 musicians. The sound pressure level to which the individual musicians are exposed depends on their instruments, their places in the orchestra and, to a lesser degree, on the composer. The following data were found for the different instrument sections: brass section: 87 to 96 dBa average levels; peaks up to 122 dBa - woodwind: 88 to 97 dBa average levels; peaks up to 117 dBa - violin and viola: 86 to 93 dBa average levels; peaks up to 110 dBa - violoncello and contrabass: 81 to 87 dBa average levels. In regard to the operas, the highest levels were measured during performances of Puccini's 'Tosca' (woodwind) and Wagner's 'Walkure' (brass), the lowest during the 'Fledermaus' by J. Strauss (contrabass). A hearing loss induced by the music cannot be excluded for the individual. Therefore audiometry has to be carried out routinely on the musicians. The problem of how to reduce the noise levels the musicians are exposed to cannot be solved realistically at the moment.

N2  - This paper is the first total survey of the occupational diseases and medically justifed occupational inabilities of the staff and members of theatres and orchestras of the German Democratic Republic. With occupational diseases, diseases of the support and locomotor system are absolutely prevailing, followed by hardness of hearing due to noise, tropic diseases, dermatoses and sporadically further diseases. With regard to the share of the staff of the various artistic professions, acrobats and dancers are affected most by work-dependent lesions of the support and locomotor system due to overstress. In the field of the workshop and stagecraft, the hardness of hearing due to noise of the joiners, mechanics and smiths and some occupational dermatoses are prevailing. The analysis of the occupational inabilities gives additional indications of occupation-dependent diseases and functional disturbances.

N2  - Minnesota Orchestra members (42 males, 18 females) aged 24 to 64 years, all asymptomatic for hearing problems or ear disease, were evaluated with a hearing history questionnaire, otolaryngologic examination, and pure tone audiometry for the conventional (0.25 to 8 kHz) and extended high frequency (9 to 20 kHz) ranges. Hearing sensitivity was examined with respect to musician instrument type, years of playing, and orchestral stage position. Type of instrument played and position on the orchestral stage had no significant correlation with hearing loss.

N2  - A case of functional hearing loss presenting as sudden sensorineural hearing loss in the only hearing ear of a musician is presented. Pure-tone audiometric evaluation showed good intratest and intertest consistency. The pitfalls of diagnosis, ultimately made by brain stem evoked response audiometry, are discussed in light of the literature on sudden and functional hearing loss. Psychiatric evaluation revealed features consistent with hysterical conversion. It is argued that it is important to establish the exact etiologic agent of functional hearing loss despite the difficulty of diagnosis so that the patient may receive appropriate treatment.

N2  - Investigations into noise-induced hearing loss should consist of two parts: a mapping of the sound environment and a charting of hearing loss. This paper is the first part of such an investigation: a mapping of sound levels and sound spectra within the symphony orchestra. It was found that 'heavy' symphonic music exceeds the permitted dose for industrial noise equivalent to 85 dB(A) for a full working week. The permitted noise dose is reached for 'heavy' music after a working time of 10 hours per week in 'exposed' positions, such as in front of trumpets, and after 25 hours in 'normal' positions. A simple method to estimate the 'noise' exposure in equivalent sound level for combinations of different sorts of music has been developed.

N2  - Hearing tests in classical musicians have been few and results inconsistent. Sound level measurements from the Lyric Theatre and Concert Hall in Gothenburg showed sound levels frequently exceeding hearing damaging levels. Equivalent sound levels for all performances showed values of 83-9 dB(A). Sound levels were slightly higher in the Lyric Theatre where musicians are crowded in an orchestra pit. Hearing tests of 139 male and female musicians from both theatres showed mean and individual pure tone thresholds indicating a sensorineural high tone loss, most frequently with a configuration consistent with an etiology of a noise-induced loss. Male musicians had poorer hearing than female musicians. The left ear demonstrated a greater loss than the right ear. Pure tone thresholds for age groups showed decreased hearing with age, particularly prominent for musicians older than 60 years of age. After age 50 a frequent finding was quite variable pure tone thresholds. In the individual analysis, 59 musicians (43%) showed worse pure tone thresholds than would be expected with regard to age. Of the different instrument groups, brasswind musicians exhibited the greatest loss. For individual instruments, French horn, trumpet, trombone and bassoon showed an increased risk of sensorineural hearing loss. Asymmetrical pure tone thresholds was a common finding both in musicians with normal hearing and sensorineural hearing loss. For these asymmetries it appeared that the violin influenced the left ear more than the right. The loudness discomfort level for pure tones was comparatively high for these musicians and a frequent finding was an unelicitable discomfort level at 120 dBHL. The acoustic reflex was also elicited at comparatively high levels. Pathologically increased levels were demonstrated in 40 musicians (approximately 30%). There is no obvious explanation for the high loudness discomfort level and for the elevated acoustic reflex levels. We suggest that the musicians' past history in working environments with widely varying sound levels may have affected the results of these audiological tests. Findings from pure tone temporary threshold shift measurements substantiated the suggestion of an ototraumatic influence of classical music. Temporary threshold shifts of moderate degree were demonstrated both after concerts and after individual musicians played their own instruments in the hearing test booth. Careful evaluation of each musician's history, in order to exclude other causes than music for the sensorineural hearing loss, indicated that participation in military bands and exposure to gunfire may have contributed to the sensorineural hearing loss. However, music was by far the most common etiological factor suggested for the 59 musicians with hearing loss. In conclusion, sound level measurements and hearing tests indicate the ototraumatic character of classical music by orchestras on a stage or in an orchestra pit. The finding is serious with regard to the unusual dependence of musicians on their hearing sensitivity.

N2  - Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is well reported among devotees of rock 'n' roll music, but less attention has been focused on players of orchestral music. Sound pressure levels have been recorded from within orchestras during performances, and audiometry has been carried out on orchestral musicians. Short-lasting peaks of sound of high amplitude were found to occur, and some players had audiometric changes consistent with NIHL. However, in practice, there seemed to be no threat to the players' continued livelihood, although the additive effect of presbyacusis in later life poses a potential problem. The difficulties of prevention of NIHL and the attenuation of the high sound levels of orchestras do not seem to be completely soluble.

N2  - Acoustic conditions were measured in the theatre orchestra during the performance of two operas (54 and 46 member orchestra, respectively) and a classical operette (31 musicians) and in the rehearsal hall of the opera (38 musicians). The equivalent sound levels at the measurement point at the conductor stand proved to be 88.7 and 90.3 dB(A), in the opera with Lmax 108 and 104 dB(A), the value in the operette being 86.4 dB(A) with Lmax 102 dB(A) and in the opera rehearsal hall 90.9 dB(A) with the Lmax 103 dB(A). A higher sound intensity was observed in front of the percussion instruments, Leqv 93.9 dB(A) with Lmax 109 dB(A). The average daily exposure of the musicians was found to last 4 to 6 hours. Professional musicians in theatre orchestras were found to be exposed for long periods of time to sound levels that might be responsible for hearing loss.

N2  - A case of a severe receptive and expressive amusia in a professional musician following a left hemisphere vascular stroke is reported. Recognition and production of single tones and random tone sequences were found to be surprisingly well preserved. In contrast, the recognition and production of simple rhythm patterns were grossly disturbed. It is suggested that amusia is due to the demonstrated rhythm disturbance. Moreover, it has been found that the defect in recognition and reproduction of rhythms was manifested regardless of the modality of perception, i.e. whether rhythm patterns were perceived by audition, vision, or touch. Therefore, the disturbance of rhythm abilities is supramodal in nature, based probably on the perception of time microintervals. Thus, this type of amusia is a result of a non-auditory supramodal defect, i.e., an impairment of temporal pattern recognition.

N2  - The article reports results of hearing tests in 83 pop musicians. Average results demonstrate a slight sensorineural hearing loss of 4 and 6 kHz. in 13 per cent of the musicians the individual analysis discloses a probabale relation between the hearing loss and exposure to pop music. The hearing loss was surprisingly small in relation to the heavy exposure. Factors contributing to explain this are a dominance of low frequencies in pop music, a considerably shorter exposure time per week than in industrial noise exposure, which in turn means longer recovery periods between exposures, and a low occurrence of harmful impulse noise.

N2  - Comparatively few previous studies have investigated the hearing of pop musicians. On the average, a suprisingly low percentage (5%) of hearing loss was demonstrated in 160 pop musicians. The present material comprises 83 musicians, with an average exposure of 9 years. Group mean hearing thresholds show only a slight deviation from normal. Age, weekly and total exposure time appear to increase the risk of hearing impairment. In the individual analysis 13-30% were found to have a sensorineural hearing loss, depending upon the definition of hearing loss. Subjects with hearing loss show a discrete impairment in the frequency range 3-8 kHz. Considering the sound levels and the length of exposure, the incidence of hearing loss is suprisingly low. Possible reasons for this are discussed.

N2  - This study was initiated to determine time weighted noise exposure to musicians and waitresses in establishments where rock music was being played. The literature is reviewed and found to contain conflicting views relative to exposure and hearing loss. The use of audio dosimeters in this study has aided in 'washing out' the problem of 'intermittent' and 'peak' exposures. Results indicate that musicians are excessively exposed in view of established criteria while the same cannot be said of waitresses or others similarly exposed.

N2  - Hearing thresholds were determined in 83 'pop' musicians with an average age of 26 years, average exposure time of 9 years and average weekly exposure time of 18 hours. The following factors had a statistically significant influence (p 95) on hearing : ageing, brief exposure per session, long exposure time in years (2 kHz), participation in military service (250 Hz), listening to pop music with head phones (2 kHz).

N2  - The development of modern civilization is associated with the ever increasing problem of noise and its damaging effect on the hearing organ. Besides work in industry there are many other possibilities and situations in which are people exposed to noise. Hearing acuity was determined in 51 musicians, members of a symphonic orchestra, who worked every day at noise exposure in the range of 86-108 dB A, with evaluation numbers N 87-103. Bilaterally normal hearing was found in 16 musicians and unilaterally in 5. In the remaining musicians hearing loss was found to a varying degree including high frequencies (4.6 and 8 kHz), less frequently 2 and 1 kHz. Attention is called to individual sensitivity of the hearing organ to noise and the effects of instrument type on the degree of hearing damage.

N2  - Relatively few investigations have so far reported on the hearing in pop musicians. In summary, these have shown a sensorineural hearing loss in 5%. This study was carried out on 83 professionals working with pop music. Depending upon how hearing loss is defined, the authors found a sensorineural loss in 13-30% of the pop musicians. Hearing losses were slight. It appears that the risk for hearing damage for the audience is small. A limit for presentation of the music at 95 dB (A) is suggested as a compromise satisfying both audiologists and audience.

N2  - The acoustic conditions during musical activity of a symphony orchestra numbering 86 members, were ascertained by measurement of sound. When the complete orchestra was playing, the mean levels of sound (L(Am)) amounted in the individual compositions within limits of 87 to 98 dB(A) to a mean value of 92 dB(A), whereby the place of measurement inside the orchestra did not influence the resulting sound parameters significantly. The limits of sound levels vary at solo play and they depend upon the type of composition and instrument: violin 84 to 103, cello 84 to 92, contrabass 75 to 83, piccolo 95 to 112, flute 85 to 111, S clarinet 92 to 103, French horn 90 to 106, hautboy 80 to 94, trombone 85 to 114, xylophone 90 to 92 dB(A). The daily exposure to music amounts to 4 to 8 hr. With regards to preventive possibilities it is possible to apply in this occupation organisational measures (regimen of work, the arrangement of concerts during the season, their adequate number); it is neither possible to take technical measures leading to a decrease of sound, nor can personal protective aids be used. Decisions on the necessity of preventive examinations in professional musicians of symphony orchestras can be made after correlations of results ascertained by measuring sound, with the results of clinical examination.

N2  - An examination of 90 professional military musicians with audiometry revealed in 66 individuals (74%) an elevation of the hearing threshold for air conduction greater than 20 dB in at least one frequency band. There was a significant dependence of the auditory disorder on the length of service in the musical corps. In most cases the hearing damage was moderate, predominantly at higher frequencies, and only in 2 individuals did it exceed 40% according to Fowler. There was no correlation between the hearing loss and the kind of musical instrument. After prolonged examinations and concerts the signs of noise syndrome were very frequent. Aural tinnitus, which appeared in 15% of examinees with hearing disorders, was mostly temporary and did not cause serious difficulties.

N2  - The intensity of musical sounds in a large wind orchestra reached 104 to 112 dB. In professional musicians, playing mostly for a series of years in a wind orchestra, hearing loss surpassing 20 dB of air conduction on at least one frequency occurred in 85 persons of 118 examined subjects. i.e., in 72%. The most frequent disorder was in the perception of high tones, while the speech frequencies were also affected in 6 persons (5%). In three of them a fast progress occurred after 55 yr of age, so that the loss surpassed 40% according to Fowler. Most of the musicians were not primarily complaining to be hard of hearing, but rather to have difficulties caused by the need of considerable concentration in the noisy environment. The complaints resembled the noise or neurasthenic syndrome and generally disappeared after sleep.

N2  - The authors present the result of a study of 2 patients with pronounced amusia, both receptive and expressive. One of the patients was a professional musician and music teacher. His gnosis for tone pitch was found to be completely retained. The 2 patients showed a loss of perception and reproduction of rhythmic structure. The rhythm gnosis and praxis were disturbed independent of the origin of perceived rhythm stimuli, patterns of clicks, flashes or touches. These data support the authors' hypothesis that rhythm gnosis is not merely a variety of auditory gnosis, but is probably a gnosis of the time intervals in the limits of short term memory. Rhythm gnosis is indispensable for musical ability, and rhythm agnosia always leads to pronounced amusia.
