TI  - Noise-induced hearing loss.
PG  - 274-80
LID - 10.4103/1463-1741.104893 [doi]
AB  - Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) still remains a problem in developed countries, 
      despite reduced occupational noise exposure, strict standards for hearing 
      protection and extensive public health awareness campaigns. Therefore NIHL 
      continues to be the focus of noise research activities. This paper summarizes 
      progress achieved recently in our knowledge of NIHL. It includes papers published 
      between the years 2008-2011 (in English), which were identified by a literature 
      search of accessible medical and other relevant databases. A substantial part of 
      this research has been concerned with the risk of NIHL in the entertainment 
      sector, particularly in professional, orchestral musicians. There are also 
      constant concerns regarding noise exposure and hearing risk in "hard to control" 
      occupations, such as farming and construction work. Although occupational noise 
      has decreased since the early 1980s, the number of young people subject to social 
      noise exposure has tripled. If the exposure limits from the Noise at Work 
      Regulations are applied, discotheque music, rock concerts, as well as music from 
      personal music players are associated with the risk of hearing loss in teenagers 
      and young adults. Several recent research studies have increased the 
      understanding of the pathomechanisms of acoustic trauma, the genetics of NIHL, as 
      well as possible dietary and pharmacologic otoprotection in acoustic trauma. The 
      results of these studies are very promising and offer grounds to expect that 
      targeted therapies might help prevent the loss of sensory hair cells and protect 
      the hearing of noise-exposed individuals. These studies emphasize the need to 
      launch an improved noise exposure policy for hearing protection along with 
      developing more efficient norms of NIHL risk assessment.

TI  - Music education for improving reading skills in children and adolescents with 
      dyslexia.
PG  - CD009133
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD009133.pub2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dyslexia (or developmental dyslexia or specific reading disability) 
      is a specific learning disorder that has a neurobiological origin. It is marked 
      by difficulties with accurate or fluent recognition of words and poor spelling in 
      people who have average or above average intelligence and these difficulties 
      cannot be attributed to another cause, for example, poor vision, hearing 
      difficulty, or lack of socio-environmental opportunities, motivation, or adequate 
      instruction. Studies have correlated reading skills with musical abilities. It 
      has been hypothesized that musical training may be able to remediate timing 
      difficulties, improve pitch perception, or increase spatial awareness, thereby 
      having a positive effect on skills needed in the development of language and 
      literacy. OBJECTIVES: To study the effectiveness of music education on reading 
      skills (that is, oral reading skills, reading comprehension, reading fluency, 
      phonological awareness, and spelling) in children and adolescents with dyslexia. 
      SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following electronic databases in June 2012: 
      CENTRAL (2012, Issue 5), MEDLINE (1948 to May Week 4 2012 ), EMBASE (1980 to 2012 
      Week 22), CINAHL (searched 7 June 2012), LILACS (searched 7 June 2012), PsycINFO 
      (1887 to May Week 5 2012), ERIC (searched 7 June 2012), Arts and Humanities 
      Citation Index (1970 to 6 June 2012), Conference Proceedings Citation Index - 
      Social Sciences and Humanities (1990 to 6 June 2012), and WorldCat (searched 7 
      June 2012). We also searched the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry 
      Platform (ICTRP) and reference lists of studies. We did not apply any date or 
      language limits. SELECTION CRITERIA: We planned to include randomized controlled 
      trials. We looked for studies that included at least one of our primary outcomes. 
      The primary outcomes were related to the main domain of the reading: oral reading 
      skills, reading comprehension, reading fluency, phonological awareness, and 
      spelling, measured through validated instruments. The secondary outcomes were 
      self esteem and academic achievement. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors 
      (HCM and RBA) independently screened all titles and abstracts identified through 
      the search strategy to determine their eligibility. For our analysis we had 
      planned to use mean difference for continuous data, with 95% confidence 
      intervals, and to use the random-effects statistical model when the effect 
      estimates of two or more studies could be combined in a meta-analysis. MAIN 
      RESULTS: We retrieved 851 references via the search strategy. No randomized 
      controlled trials testing music education for the improvement of reading skills 
      in children with dyslexia could be included in this review. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: 
      There is no evidence available from randomized controlled trials on which to base 
      a judgment about the effectiveness of music education for the improvement of 
      reading skills in children and adolescents with dyslexia. This uncertainty 
      warrants further research via randomized controlled trials, involving a 
      interdisciplinary team: musicians, hearing and speech therapists, psychologists, 
      and physicians.

TI  - Occupational Injuries in Musicians: A Literature Review.
PG  - e619-e623
LID - 10.1093/milmed/usab499 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The U.S. Department of Defense employs more musicians than any 
      other organization in the USA with over 6,000 musicians employed. Musculoskeletal 
      pathologies, behavioral health disorders, hearing loss, and dystonias account for 
      the majority of reasons a musician seek medical care. The aim of this study is to 
      review recent medical literature documenting occupational hazards in musicians. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Authors performed a literature review of publications 
      related to musician performance-related musculoskeletal disorders (PRMDs) and 
      performance-related pain (PRP), behavioral health disorders, dystonias, and 
      hearing loss, published from 2004 to 2019 PubMed. RESULTS: The search returned 
      174 possible articles which, after review and exclusion, yielded 88 articles. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Medical literature suggests several risk factors for multiple 
      disease categories. Practice time and history of PRMD/PRP were both associated 
      with development of PRMD/PRP and focal dystonia. A history of behavioral health 
      disorder was associated with development of focal dystonia. Clinicians should 
      counsel their musician patients on strategies to minimize risks, and additional 
      research is needed to identify specific causes of illnesses in musician 
      populations.

TI  - Instrumental musicians' hazards.
PG  - 619-31, iv-v
AB  - In the last two decades, injuries to instrumental musicians have been well 
      documented. Major categories of performance-related injuries include 
      musculoskeletal overuse, nerve entrapment/thoracic outlet syndrome, and focal 
      dystonia. Other areas of concern to instrumentalists include hypermobility, 
      osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, and hearing loss. This chapter reviews the 
      epidemiology, risk factors, physical exam, treatment, and prevention of common 
      problems of instrumentalists. Emphasis is placed on the team approach of 
      treatment and prevention and the need for close collaboration of the various 
      health professionals, music educators, and performers. Additional resources are 
      presented for those interested in pursuing performing arts medicine in greater 
      detail.

TI  - Noise-induced hearing loss and its prevention: Integration of data from animal 
      models and human clinical trials.
PG  - 4051
LID - 10.1121/1.5132951 [doi]
AB  - Animal models have been used to gain insight into the risk of noise-induced 
      hearing loss (NIHL) and its potential prevention using investigational new drug 
      agents. A number of compounds have yielded benefit in pre-clinical (animal) 
      models. However, the acute traumatic injury models commonly used in pre-clinical 
      testing are fundamentally different from the chronic and repeated exposures 
      experienced by many human populations. Diverse populations that are potentially 
      at risk and could be considered for enrollment in clinical studies include 
      service members, workers exposed to occupational noise, musicians and other 
      performing artists, and children and young adults exposed to non-occupational 
      (including recreational) noise. Both animal models and clinical populations were 
      discussed in this special issue, followed by discussion of individual variation 
      in vulnerability to NIHL. In this final contribution, study design considerations 
      for NIHL otoprotection in pre-clinical and clinical testing are integrated and 
      broadly discussed with evidence-based guidance offered where possible, drawing on 
      the contributions to this special issue as well as other existing literature. The 
      overarching goals of this final paper are to (1) review and summarize key 
      information across contributions and (2) synthesize information to facilitate 
      successful translation of otoprotective drugs from animal models into human 
      application.

TI  - Musician and Nonmusician Hearing Aid Setting Preferences for Music and Speech 
      Stimuli.
PG  - 333-347
LID - 10.1044/2019_AJA-18-0125 [doi]
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study was to evaluate potential group differences 
      between musicians and nonmusicians in their self-adjusted (SA) gain and 
      compression settings for both music and speech stimuli. Speech recognition, sound 
      quality, and strength of preference for the SA settings and the original 
      prescriptive (National Acoustic Laboratories-Nonlinear 2 [NAL-NL2]) settings were 
      also compared. Method Participants included 12 musician ( M = 60 years) and 12 
      nonmusician ( M = 55 years) adult hearing aid users with mild-moderate hearing 
      loss, on average. Self-adjustments were made to hearing aid gain and compression 
      settings for 2 music stimuli and a speech stimulus. Speech recognition in quiet 
      and noise, sound quality for 6 dimensions (clarity, pleasantness, naturalness, 
      fullness, brightness, and overall impression), and strength of preference ratings 
      using paired comparisons were then assessed at both the NAL-NL2 settings and the 
      participants' SA settings. Results On average, self-adjustments made by both 
      groups were quite small (< 5 dB for gain and < 0.5 for compression ratio). 
      Furthermore, SA changes to gain and compression ratio were not significantly 
      different for musicians versus nonmusicians or for music versus speech. Finally, 
      speech perception performance and sound quality ratings did not differ for the SA 
      settings versus the NAL-NL2 settings, with the exception of the naturalness sound 
      quality dimension. Conclusions These data suggest that a gain-frequency response 
      specific to musicians and/or music inputs may not be necessary. Thus, current, 
      validated prescriptive methods continue to be well supported as an appropriate 
      starting place for listeners with mild-moderate hearing loss using open hearing 
      aid fittings.

TI  - Hearing Health in College Instrumental Musicians and Prevention of Hearing Loss.
PG  - 29-36
LID - 10.21091/mppa.2016.1006 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: College musicians exhibit greater declines in hearing than the general 
      population and are at particular risk because they rehearse and perform daily in 
      loud environments. Also, they engage in use of personal listening devices which 
      increases the amount of "exposure" time. Despite increased risk, many do not use 
      hearing protection devices (HPD). The purpose of this study was to (1) to 
      identify the present level of education about hearing health, (2) identify the 
      perceived advantages and disadvantages of using HPD, and (3) evaluate results 
      among different musical instrument groups. METHODS: A mixed-methods group design 
      was used including both quantitative and qualitative instruments. SPSS was used 
      to generate descriptive statistics, and non-parametric statistical analysis was 
      performed on quantitative data. NVivo software was used to evaluate qualitative 
      responses. RESULTS: Of the 90 college instrumental music students who 
      participated, 12% reported a history of hearing loss, and over one-third reported 
      tinnitus. Seventy-seven percent of participants had never received any training 
      about hearing health and only a small percentage of students used HPD. The most 
      cited reason for lack of protection use was its negative impact on sound quality. 
      However, group differences were noted between brass, woodwind, and percussion 
      musicians in terms of HPD uptake. CONCLUSION: Improving the type of information 
      disseminated to college musicians may reduce the risk of ear-related deficits. 
      Noise dosage information, HPD information, and prevention education grounded in 
      theories like the Health Belief Model may increase awareness and promote greater 
      use of HPDs in this population.

AB  - Historically, the primary concern for hearing aid design and fitting is 
      optimization for speech inputs. However, increasingly other types of inputs are 
      being investigated and this is certainly the case for music. Whether the hearing 
      aid wearer is a musician or merely someone who likes to listen to music, the 
      electronic and electro-acoustic parameters described can be optimized for music 
      as well as for speech. That is, a hearing aid optimally set for music can be 
      optimally set for speech, even though the converse is not necessarily true. 
      Similarities and differences between speech and music as inputs to a hearing aid 
      are described. Many of these lead to the specification of a set of optimal 
      electro-acoustic characteristics. Parameters such as the peak input-limiting 
      level, compression issues-both compression ratio and knee-points-and number of 
      channels all can deleteriously affect music perception through hearing aids. In 
      other cases, it is not clear how to set other parameters such as noise reduction 
      and feedback control mechanisms. Regardless of the existence of a "music 
      program,'' unless the various electro-acoustic parameters are available in a 
      hearing aid, music fidelity will almost always be less than optimal. There are 
      many unanswered questions and hypotheses in this area. Future research by 
      engineers, researchers, clinicians, and musicians will aid in the clarification 
      of these questions and their ultimate solutions.

AB  - Context and aims: Many musicians suffer for their art, and health is often 
      compromised during training. The Health Promotion in Schools of Music (HPSM) 
      project has recommended that health education should be included in core 
      curricula, although few such courses have been evaluated to date. The aim of the 
      study was to design, implement and evaluate a compulsory health education course 
      at a UK conservatoire of music. Methods: The course design was informed by a 
      critical appraisal of the literature on musicians' health problems and their 
      management, existing health education courses for musicians, and the HPSM 
      recommendations. It was delivered by a team of appropriately-qualified tutors 
      over 5 months to 104 first-year undergraduate students, and evaluated by means of 
      questionnaires at the beginning and end of the course. Thirty-three students who 
      had been in their first year the year before the course was introduced served as 
      a control group, completing the questionnaire on one occasion only. Items 
      concerned: hearing and use of hearing protection; primary outcomes including 
      perceived knowledge and importance of the topics taught on the course; and 
      secondary outcomes including physical and psychological health and 
      health-promoting behaviors. The content of the essays written by the first-year 
      students as part of their course assessment served as a guide to the topics they 
      found most interesting and relevant. Results: Comparatively few respondents 
      reported using hearing protection when practicing alone, although there was some 
      evidence of hearing loss, tinnitus, and hyperacusis. Perceived knowledge of the 
      topics on the course, and awareness of the risks to health associated with 
      performing music, increased, as did self-efficacy; otherwise, there were negative 
      effects on secondary outcomes, and few differences between the intervention and 
      control groups. The topics most frequently covered in students' essays were 
      managing music performance anxiety, and life skills and behavior change 
      techniques. Conclusion: There is considerable scope for improving music students' 
      physical and psychological health and health-related behaviors through health 
      education, and persuading senior managers, educators and students themselves that 
      health education can contribute to performance enhancement.

TI  - Hearing loss and tinnitus in rock musicians: A Norwegian survey.
PG  - 411-21
LID - 10.4103/1463-1741.169708 [doi]
AB  - Our focus in this study was to assess hearing thresholds and the prevalence and 
      characteristics of tinnitus in a large group of rock musicians based in Norway. A 
      further objective was to assess related factors such as exposure, instrument 
      category, and the preventive effect of hearing protection. The study was a 
      cross-sectional survey of rock musicians selected at random from a defined cohort 
      of musicians. A random control group was included for comparison. We recruited 
      111 active musicians from the Oslo region, and a control group of 40 nonmusicians 
      from the student population at the University of TromsØ. The subjects were 
      investigated using clinical examination, pure tone audiometry, tympanometry, and 
      a questionnaire. We observed a hearing loss in 37.8% of the rock musicians. 
      Significantly poorer hearing thresholds were seen at most pure-tone frequencies 
      in musicians than controls, with the most pronounced threshold shift at 6 kHz. 
      The use of hearing protection, in particular custom-fitted earplugs, has a 
      preventive effect but a minority of rock musicians apply them consistently. The 
      degree of musical performance exposure was inversely related to the degree of 
      hearing loss in our sample. Bass and guitar players had higher hearing thresholds 
      than vocalists. We observed a 20% prevalence of chronic tinnitus but none of the 
      affected musicians had severe tinnitus symptomatology. There was no statistical 
      association between permanent tinnitus and hearing loss in our sample. We 
      observed an increased prevalence of hearing loss and tinnitus in our sample of 
      Norwegian rock musicians but the causal relationship between musical exposure and 
      hearing loss or tinnitus is ambiguous. We recommend the use of hearing protection 
      in rock musicians.

TI  - Hearing Loss, Tinnitus, Hyperacusis, and Diplacusis in Professional Musicians: A 
      Systematic Review.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph15102120 [doi]
LID - 2120
AB  - Professional musicians (PMs) are at high risk of developing hearing loss (HL) and 
      other audiological symptoms such as tinnitus, hyperacusis, and diplacusis. The 
      aim of this systematic review is to (A) assess the risk of developing HL and 
      audiological symptoms in PMs and (B) evaluate if different music genres (Pop/Rock 
      Music-PR; Classical Music-CL) expose PMs to different levels of risk of 
      developing such conditions. Forty-one articles including 4618 PMs were included 
      in the study. HL was found in 38.6% PMs; prevalence was significantly higher 
      among PR (63.5%) than CL (32.8%) PMs; HL mainly affected the high frequencies in 
      the 3000-6000 Hz range and was symmetric in 68% PR PMs and in 44.5% CL PMs. 
      Tinnitus was the most common audiological symptom, followed by hyperacusis and 
      diplacusis. Tinnitus was almost equally distributed between PR and CL PMs; 
      diplacusis was more common in CL than in PR PMs, while prevalence of hyperacusis 
      was higher among PR PMs. Our review showed that PR musicians have a higher risk 
      of developing HL compared to CL PMs; exposure to sounds of high frequency and 
      intensity and absence of ear protection may justify these results. Difference in 
      HL symmetry could be explained by the type of instruments used and consequent 
      single-sided exposure.

LID - 10.1111/nyas.14810 [doi]
AB  - Hearing abilities decline with age, and one of the most commonly reported hearing 
      issues in older adults is a difficulty understanding speech when there is loud 
      background noise. Understanding speech in noise relies on numerous cognitive 
      processes, including working memory, and is supported by numerous brain regions, 
      including the motor and motor planning systems. Indeed, many working memory 
      processes are supported by motor and premotor cortical regions. Interestingly, 
      lifelong musicians and nonmusicians given music training over the course of weeks 
      or months show an improved ability to understand speech when there is loud 
      background noise. These benefits are associated with enhanced working memory 
      abilities, and enhanced activity in motor and premotor cortical regions. 
      Accordingly, it is likely that music training improves the coupling between the 
      auditory and motor systems and promotes plasticity in these regions and regions 
      that feed into auditory/motor areas. This leads to an enhanced ability to 
      dynamically process incoming acoustic information, and is likely the reason that 
      musicians and those who receive laboratory-based music training are better able 
      to understand speech when there is background noise. Critically, these findings 
      suggest that music-based forms of auditory rehabilitation are possible and should 
      focus on tasks that promote auditory-motor interactions.

TI  - Hearing loss in musicians.
PG  - 122-7
AB  - Hearing is of special vocational importance in musicians. Musical performance may 
      create sounds sufficiently intense to cause sensorineural hearing loss. Although 
      such losses are usually not severe enough to be compensable under American 
      Academy of Otolaryngology guidelines for occupational hearing loss, they may 
      interfere with the musician's ability to perform the daily tasks of his or her 
      profession. A review of the literature on occupational hearing loss in musicians 
      reveals a substantial need for further research.

TI  - Assessment of noise level and risk of hearing loss among taiko musicians.
PG  - 457-463
LID - 10.47626/1679-4435-2020-591 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: taiko music is performed with specific drums, which produce loud 
      and low-tone sounds that can potentially lead to hearing risk. OBJECTIVES: To 
      assess sound pressure levels and hearing safety of musicians who play in taiko 
      groups. METHODS: Using a decibel meter, noise exposure was measured in two 
      different groups (group 1 and group 2), which are divided into categories: (group 
      1 = five categories - junior, free, general a, general b, and master, and group 2 
      = two categories - adult and child). The calculation of the daily noise dose was 
      based on the Brazilian Occupational Hygiene Standard 01, which establishes the 
      following classification: acceptable dose (between 0 and 50%), above the action 
      level (50 to 80%), uncertain dose level (80 to 100%), and above the acceptable 
      level (more than 100%). RESULTS: In group 1 categories, the daily noise doses 
      obtained were: junior = 88%; general B = 423%; master = 218%; general A = 370%, 
      and free = 150%. In the adult and children categories of group 2, the results 
      were 127 and 17%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: taiko musicians are exposed to daily 
      noise doses above the safe level, except for the junior categories in group 1, 
      and the children, in group 2 - which showed daily noise doses at an uncertain 
      dose level, and at an acceptable level, respectively.

TI  - Effect of Hearing Protection Use on Pianists' Performance and Experience: 
      Comparing Foam and Musician Earplugs.
PG  - 886861

LID - 886861
AB  - Professional musicians are often exposed to high noise levels and thus face the 
      risk of noise-induced hearing loss. Yet, adoption rates for hearing protection 
      among musicians are low. Previous surveys indicate that the chief concern is the 
      effect of hearing protection use on performance. However, few studies have 
      investigated actual changes in performance when wearing hearing protection. We 
      report an experiment investigating differences in pianists' performance and 
      experience with and without hearing protection. We compare the effect of foam 
      earplugs and musician earplugs, designed to preserve sound quality with a flat 
      frequency response. The analysis revealed that participants performed overall 
      more loudly with the foam earplugs than with the musician earplugs, and in turn 
      performances with the musician earplugs were louder than the open condition, 
      indicating a compensatory effect. However, this effect was stronger for novel 
      excerpts than for familiar excerpts. No effect was observed on dynamic range. 
      Furthermore, we observed an acclimatization effect, whereby the effect of hearing 
      protection use, observed on the first performance, decreased on the second 
      performance. In terms of experience, participants reported changes in coloration, 
      difficulties gauging dynamics and articulation, and increased effort required 
      when performing with hearing protection. These effects were more pronounced when 
      wearing the foam earplugs, and the participants reported finding the musician 
      earplugs more comfortable to wear and play with. In conclusion, hearing 
      protection use affects pianists' performance particularly in terms of dynamics 
      and their experience more so in terms of coloration. But the effects are less 
      marked for familiar pieces and after repetition, suggesting that pianists can 
      quickly adjust their playing when playing familiar pieces with hearing 
      protection.

TI  - Noise-induced hearing loss and symphony orchestra musicians: risk factors, 
      effects, and management.
PG  - 13-8
AB  - Although industrial and recreational noise have been recognized as potential 
      causes of noise-induced hearing loss for quite some time, it is only recently 
      that the sound levels within a symphony orchestra have been implicated as 
      possible sources of harmful noise levels. Many studies have concluded that not 
      only are dangerous levels of noise present within the symphony orchestra, but 
      there is evidence of noise-induced hearing loss among symphony orchestra 
      musicians. Although hearing protection designed for industrial use may not be 
      appropriate for the special listening needs of professional musicians, recent 
      advances in hearing protection design have made hearing protection practical for 
      this population. Suggestions are made for monitoring and protecting the 
      professional ear.

AB  - The ability to understand speech in the presence of competing sound sources is an 
      important neuroscience question in terms of how the nervous system solves this 
      computational problem. It is also a critical clinical problem that 
      disproportionally affects the elderly, children with language-related learning 
      disorders, and those with hearing loss. Recent evidence that musicians have an 
      advantage on this multifaceted skill has led to the suggestion that musical 
      training might be used to improve or delay the decline of speech-in-noise (SIN) 
      function. However, enhancements have not been universally reported, nor have the 
      relative contributions of different bottom-up versus top-down processes, and 
      their relation to preexisting factors been disentangled. This information that 
      would be helpful to establish whether there is a real effect of experience, what 
      exactly is its nature, and how future training-based interventions might target 
      the most relevant components of cognitive processes. These questions are 
      complicated by important differences in study design and uneven coverage of 
      neuroimaging modality. In this review, we aim to systematize recent results from 
      studies that have specifically looked at musician-related differences in SIN by 
      their study design properties, to summarize the findings, and to identify 
      knowledge gaps for future work.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this investigation was to assess the effects of 
      earplugs on acoustical and perceptual measures of choral and solo sound. METHODS: 
      The researcher tested the effects of musician's earplugs on choral and solo 
      timbre and singer perceptions. Members of an intact women's university choir 
      recorded Dona Nobis Pacem under two conditions, no earplugs and with earplugs 
      over time. Approximately half of the choir members also participated as soloists, 
      recording Over the Rainbow under the same two conditions. All recordings were 
      analyzed using long-term average spectra (LTAS). After participating in each 
      recording session, the participants responded to a questionnaire about ability to 
      hear self (solo and choral context) and ability to hear others (choral context) 
      under two conditions, no earplugs and with earplugs. RESULTS: LTAS results 
      revealed that wearing earplugs in a choral setting caused decreased mean signal 
      energy (>1 dB), resulting in less resonant singing. LTAS results also indicated 
      that wearing earplugs in a solo setting had less effect on mean signal energy, 
      resulting in a mean difference <1 dB in 3 of the 4 weeks studied. Singer 
      questionnaire responses showed that wearing earplugs had a greater effect on 
      participants' ability to hear others than it did on their ability to hear 
      themselves. CONCLUSIONS: In the context of this study, it seems that wearing 
      earplugs had more effect on timbre and the ability to receive sufficient auditory 
      feedback in a choral setting than it did in a solo setting. Findings from this 
      study could provide important information when structuring hearing conservation 
      strategies.

TI  - Exposure to music and noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) among professional 
      pop/rock/jazz musicians.
PG  - 158-64
LID - 10.4103/1463-1741.155848 [doi]
AB  - Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) has been extensively studied in industrial work 
      environments. With the advent of new technologies, loud music has been 
      increasingly affecting listeners outside of the industrial setting. Most research 
      on the effects of music and hearing loss has focused on classical musicians. The 
      purpose of the current study was to examine the relationship between the amount 
      of experience a professional pop/rock/jazz musician has and objective and 
      subjective variables of the musician's hearing loss. This study also examined 
      professional pop/rock/jazz musicians' use of hearing protection devices in 
      relation to the extent of their exposure to amplified music. Forty-four 
      pop/rock/jazz musicians were interviewed using the Pop/Rock/Jazz Musician's 
      Questionnaire (PRJMQ) in order to obtain self-reported symptoms of tinnitus and 
      hyperacusis. Forty-two of the subjects were also tested for air-conduction 
      hearing thresholds in the frequency range of 1-8 kHz. Results show that the 
      extent of professional pop/rock/jazz musicians' exposure to amplified music was 
      related to both objective and subjective variables of hearing loss: Greater 
      musical experience was positively linked to higher hearing thresholds in the 
      frequency range of 3-6 kHz and to the subjective symptom of tinnitus. Weekly 
      hours playing were found to have a greater effect on hearing loss in comparison 
      to years playing. Use of hearing protection was not linked to the extent of 
      exposure to amplified music. It is recommended that further research be conducted 
      with a larger sample, in order to gain a greater understanding of the detrimental 
      effects of hours playing versus years playing.

TI  - Influence of occupational noise on hearing: systematic review of foreign 
      literature.
PG  - 48-53
AB  - The article is aimed to systematically review evidence-based data published in 
      foreign literature on influence of level and characteristics of occupational 
      noise on hearing loss. Search of the literature was based on key words 
      "occupational noise exposure, permissible exposure limit, dose-response 
      relationship, acceptable noise level, noise-induced hearing loss" The authors 
      studied 349 publications, 7 out of which were included into the present 
      systematic review. Findings are that developed countries demonstrate a tendency 
      to decreased prevalence of hearing loss among workers exposed to noise. 
      Occupational groups with increased risk include workers of mining, machinery, 
      light industries and agriculture. Lower occupational risk or no risk of hearing 
      loss is seen in education, transport workers, musicians and other groups. 
      Occupational noise level of 80 dB is a theoretically minimal exposure level 
      resulting in no increase in hearing loss risk. Following normal noise level at 85 
      dB could decrease prevalence of hearing loss due to noise.

AB  - It has been generally accepted that excessive exposure to loud music causes 
      various hearing symptoms (e.g. tinnitus) and consequently leads to a risk of 
      permanent hearing damage, known as noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). Such 
      potential risk of NIHL due to loud music exposure has been widely investigated in 
      musicians and people working in music venues. With advancements in sound 
      technology and rapid developments in the music industry, increasing numbers of 
      people, particularly adolescents and young adults, are exposing themselves to 
      music on a voluntary basis at potentially harmful levels, and over a substantial 
      period of time, which can also cause NIHL. However, because of insufficient 
      audiometric evidence of hearing loss caused purely by music exposure, there is 
      still disagreement and speculation about the risk of hearing loss from music 
      exposure alone. Many studies have suggested using advanced audiological 
      measurements as more sensitive and efficient tools to monitor hearing status as 
      early indicators of cochlear dysfunction. The purpose of this review is to 
      provide further insight into the potential risk of hearing loss caused by 
      exposure to loud music, and thus contribute to further raising awareness of music 
      induced hearing loss.

AB  - Orchestral musicians are an at-risk population for noise-induced hearing loss. 
      Following strategic approaches to mitigate exposure, many must use earplugs to 
      safeguard their hearing, although reported usage rates are poor. Australia has 
      progressive hearing conservation programs within many of its orchestras, yet 
      little is known of earplug usage rates, abilities with earplugs or self-perceived 
      hearing loss in this population. To help direct and inform future approaches to 
      hearing conservation in Australia's orchestras a questionnaire assessing hearing 
      conservation behaviors and the prevalence of self-perceived hearing loss was 
      distributed. A total of 580 musicians across eight professional orchestras were 
      surveyed, with 367 completed surveys (63%) returned. Eighty percent of 
      respondents reported a risk of hearing damage in the orchestra, 64% used earplugs 
      of some type at least some of the time and 83% found this use 
      difficult/impossible. Forty-three percent reported a hearing loss, including 54% 
      in pit orchestras and 46% of those ≤50 years of age. Brass players were least 
      likely to use earplugs, most likely to report usage difficulties and most likely 
      of those ≤50 years of age to report a hearing loss. While earplug usage rates in 
      Australia are encouraging and may be linked to hearing conservation measures in 
      the orchestras, the widespread difficulty reported with the use of these 
      earplugs, the prevalence of self-reported hearing loss and the continued 
      vulnerability of those most at-risk indicate improvements in both earplug design 
      and further education for musicians are required to progress hearing conservation 
      options for this population.

TI  - Noise induced hearing loss and other hearing complaints among musicians of 
      symphony orchestras.
PG  - 153-64
LID - 10.1007/s00420-008-0317-1 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: An investigation of the hearing status of musicians of professional 
      symphony orchestras. Main questions are: (1) Should musicians be treated as a 
      special group with regard to hearing, noise, and noise related hearing problems 
      (2) Do patterns of hearing damage differ for different instrument types (3) Do 
      OAE have an added value in the diagnosis of noise induced hearing loss (NIHL) in 
      musicians. METHODS: 241 professional musicians, aged between 23-64 participated. 
      A brief medical history and the subjective judgment of their hearing and hearing 
      problems were assessed. Musicians were subjected to an extensive audiological 
      test battery, which contained testing of audiometric thresholds, loudness 
      perception, diplacusis, tinnitus, speech perception in noise, and otoacoustic 
      emissions. RESULTS: Most musicians could be categorized as normal hearing, but 
      their audiograms show notches at 6 kHz, a frequency that is associated with NIHL. 
      Musicians often complained about tinnitus and hyperacusis, while diplacusis was 
      generally not reported as a problem. Tinnitus was most often localized utmost 
      left and this could not be related to the instrument. It was usually perceived in 
      high frequency areas, associated with NIHL. In general, musicians scored very 
      well on the speech-in-noise test. The results of the loudness perception test 
      were within normal limits. Otoacoustic emissions were more intense with better 
      pure-tone thresholds, but due to large individual differences it can still not be 
      used as an objective test for early detection of NIHL. CONCLUSIONS: Musicians 
      show more noise induced hearing loss than could be expected on the basis of age 
      and gender. Other indicators, such as complaints and prevalence of tinnitus, 
      complaints about hyperacusis and prevalence of diplacusis suggest that musicians' 
      ears are at risk. Continuing education about the risks of intensive sound 
      exposure to musicians, with the emphasis on the possible development of tinnitus 
      and hyperacusis and the need for good hearing protection is warranted.

PG  - 41-46
LID - 10.4103/nah.NAH_40_19 [doi]
AB  - Choir singing is a very popular activity with 4.5% of the European population 
      regularly participating. London South Bank University was approached in January 
      2019 by St Paul's Cathedral to undertake noise dosimetry for the Music 
      Department. Rehearsals and performances were identified and measured using 
      acoustic instrumentation to determine if the choristers, adult choir, choir 
      master or organist were compliant with the Control of Noise at Work Regulations 
      2005. These data were then matched to the daily and weekly work schedules of the 
      musicians and the sound exposure estimated. The adult choir, organist and choir 
      master were found to be under the set daily limits, 85 dBA (L(EP,d)). The most 
      exposed chorister was above this limit. However, when adjusted for their shorter 
      working year and using the weekly noise exposure limit of 87 dBA (L(EP,w)), the 
      estimated exposure was compliant with the regulations. Recommendations were 
      presented to the Music Department focusing on management techniques to reduce the 
      weekly exposure of the choristers without effecting the spirit, tradition or 
      musicality of the performance. It was also strongly suggested to reduce the 
      number of performances for the boys by introducing a second choir.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cape Town Minstrel Carnival is one of the oldest and most authentic 
      indigenous New Year's customs in South Africa. Musicians who perform at this 
      carnival are exposed to excessively loud music and therefore at a risk of 
      acquiring noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to 
      determine patterns of exposure to loud music and prevalence of hearing loss 
      amongst Cape Town Minstrel Carnival musicians. METHOD: A descriptive, 
      observational exploratory survey design was used and 43 participants (21 males 
      and 22 females; mean age, 21 ± 9 years) took part in this study. Sound level 
      measurements were conducted to assess musicians' sound exposure during rehearsals 
      and performances. All participants underwent the following audiological test 
      battery at least 2 h before music exposure: Case history, otoscopic examination, 
      tympanometry, pure tone audiometry and distortion products otoacoustic emission 
      (DPOAE). RESULTS: Average noise levels recorded were 86 dBA during rehearsals and 
      98.7 dBA at performances and average durations of exposure were 240 and 10 min at 
      rehearsals and performances, respectively. One out of 43 (1/43) participants 
      presented with sensorineural hearing loss. Audiometric results of the remaining 
      participants were normal and did not show a pattern suggestive of NIHL. A high 
      proportion of participants (21/43) reported experiencing tinnitus. CONCLUSION: 
      Despite being exposed to high levels of noise, there was a low prevalence of 
      hearing loss amongst these musicians. However, a high proportion of them reported 
      tinnitus, which could be an indication that they were at a high risk of NIHL from 
      the music that they played.

LID - 10.1539/joh.16-0217-OA [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: After presbycusis, noise exposure is considered the second cause of 
      sensorineural hearing loss. Due to exposure to high-intensity sounds, musicians 
      may be at risk of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). Given the importance of good 
      hearing in music career, this study aimed to investigate the frequency of hearing 
      loss and use of protective measures among Iranian musicians. METHODS: In this 
      cross-sectional study, 125 musicians, including 21 women (16.8%) and 104 men 
      (83.2%), with at least five years of work experience were recruited. All 
      participants underwent clinical and audiometric examinations. Demographic data, 
      complaints about hearing loss, and information about the use of protective 
      devices were collected through interviews. RESULTS: Audiometric notch in either 
      one or both ears and bilateral hearing loss were present in respectively 42.4% 
      and 19.2% of the participants. The history of tinnitus after performance and ear 
      pain during performance was reported by 64 (51%) and 35 (28%) individuals, 
      respectively. Less than 2% of the participants used hearing protection devices. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Long-term exposure to loud sounds puts musicians at risk of hearing 
      loss. However, due to their inadequate knowledge, most musicians never use 
      protective devices to prevent damage to their auditory system.

TI  - Maladies in musicians.
PG  - 727-34
AB  - Certain medical ailments occur with increased frequency among musicians and can 
      affect musicians of all ages and ability. These maladies range in severity from 
      incidental, asymptomatic findings among casual a nd occasional players to serious 
      injuries that significantly disable professional musicians from practicing or 
      performing. The most prevalent problems involve overuse of muscles resulting from 
      repetitive movements of playing, often in combination with prolonged weight 
      bearing in an awkward position. Other common problems include dermatologic 
      irritation, peripheral neuropathies, focal dystonias, and otolaryngologic 
      disorders. This review organizes the musical maladies according to section of the 
      orchestra with further subclassification by pathologic process. By becoming 
      familiar with the disorders associated with specific instruments, physicians will 
      be better able to make the correct diagnosis in musicians with medical 
      complaints.

TI  - Noise exposure and hearing loss in classical orchestra musicians: A five-year 
      follow-up.
PG  - 42-46
LID - 10.4103/nah.NAH_39_17 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study is a follow-up to prior research from our group that 
      attempts to relate noise exposure and hearing thresholds in active performing 
      musicians of the National Ballet of Canada Orchestra. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      Exposures obtained in early 2010 were compared to exposures obtained in early 
      2017 (the present study). In addition, audiometric thresholds obtained in early 
      2012 were compared to thresholds obtained in early 2017 (the present study). This 
      collection of measurements presents an opportunity to observe the regularities in 
      the patterns of exposure as well as threshold changes that may be expected in 
      active orchestra musicians over a 5-year span. RESULTS: The pattern of noise 
      exposure across instrument groups, which was consistent over the two time points, 
      reveals highest exposures among brass, percussion/basses, and woodwinds. However, 
      the average noise exposure across groups and time was consistently below 85 dBA, 
      which suggests no occupational hazard. These observations were corroborated by 
      audiometric thresholds, which were generally (a) in the normal range and (b) 
      unchanged in the 5-year period between measurements. CONCLUSION: Because exposure 
      levels were consistently below 85 dBA and changes in audiometric thresholds were 
      minimal, we conclude that musicians experienced little-to-no risk of 
      noise-induced hearing loss.

AB  - Most studies of hearing loss prevention in the music industry focus on the risk 
      of hearing injury to musicians. However, live-music sound engineers (LMSE) may 
      also be at risk of hearing injury due to their work-related sound exposure. We 
      studied 27 LMSE, all of whom underwent otologic examination, including 
      audiometry, distortion product otoacoustic emissions, speech discrimination and 
      uncomfortable loudness levels, and completed a questionnaire investigating their 
      history of sound exposure and use of hearing protectors. Hearing thresholds were 
      significantly poorer than normative data across several frequencies, and a 
      substantial proportion reported constant tinnitus (30%) and reduced sound 
      tolerance (41%). Use of hearing protection was relatively low, with many 
      reporting interference with their job when using it. Our results suggest that 
      LMSE are at risk of hearing injury due to their work-related sound exposure.

AB  - During an orchestral performance musicians are exposed to high noise levels, 
      which may exceed the intensity which could evoke hearing impairment after many 
      years of exposure. From experience the degree of hearing loss in musicians is in 
      general less than would be expected from the levels of exposure. The likelihood 
      that an orchestral musician would develop a noise-induced hearing loss is much 
      lower than for an industrial worker in a noise-intense factory. On the other hand 
      it has to be considered that it is imperative for musicians to have non-impaired 
      hearing to practise their profession. In some cases a sudden onset of hearing 
      loss is traced to the noise stress of a loud performance. In such cases, the high 
      noise levels predominantly produced by brass instruments or drums were assumed to 
      be the cause. This publication presents five cases of expert opinions, where 
      previous expert opinions had assumed noise or a blast trauma as the cause for the 
      hearing loss. By careful analysis, a noise or a blast trauma was not regarded as 
      probable in any of the cases. Interestingly, three of the five musicians had a 
      normal contralateral hearing. In one case normal bilateral hearing was observed 
      without the typical c(5) notch although the musician had been subject to noise 
      stress in an orchestra for years.

      review.
PG  - 575-85
LID - 10.3766/jaaa.21.9.3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Speech-in-noise (SIN) perception is one of the most complex tasks 
      faced by listeners on a daily basis. Although listening in noise presents 
      challenges for all listeners, background noise inordinately affects speech 
      perception in older adults and in children with learning disabilities. Hearing 
      thresholds are an important factor in SIN perception, but they are not the only 
      factor. For successful comprehension, the listener must perceive and attend to 
      relevant speech features, such as the pitch, timing, and timbre of the target 
      speaker's voice. Here, we review recent studies linking SIN and brainstem 
      processing of speech sounds. PURPOSE: To review recent work that has examined the 
      ability of the auditory brainstem response to complex sounds (cABR), which 
      reflects the nervous system's transcription of pitch, timing, and timbre, to be 
      used as an objective neural index for hearing-in-noise abilities. STUDY SAMPLE: 
      We examined speech-evoked brainstem responses in a variety of populations, 
      including children who are typically developing, children with language-based 
      learning impairment, young adults, older adults, and auditory experts (i.e., 
      musicians). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: In a number of studies, we recorded 
      brainstem responses in quiet and babble noise conditions to the speech syllable 
      /da/ in all age groups, as well as in a variable condition in children in which 
      /da/ was presented in the context of seven other speech sounds. We also measured 
      speech-in-noise perception using the Hearing-in-Noise Test (HINT) and the Quick 
      Speech-in-Noise Test (QuickSIN). RESULTS: Children and adults with poor SIN 
      perception have deficits in the subcortical spectrotemporal representation of 
      speech, including low-frequency spectral magnitudes and the timing of transient 
      response peaks. Furthermore, auditory expertise, as engendered by musical 
      training, provides both behavioral and neural advantages for processing speech in 
      noise. CONCLUSIONS: These results have implications for future assessment and 
      management strategies for young and old populations whose primary complaint is 
      difficulty hearing in background noise. The cABR provides a clinically applicable 
      metric for objective assessment of individuals with SIN deficits, for 
      determination of the biologic nature of disorders affecting SIN perception, for 
      evaluation of appropriate hearing aid algorithms, and for monitoring the efficacy 
      of auditory remediation and training.

AB  - Presentation of music as vibration to the skin has the potential to facilitate 
      interaction between musicians with hearing impairments and other musicians during 
      group performance. Vibrotactile thresholds have been determined to assess the 
      potential for vibrotactile presentation of music to the glabrous skin of the 
      fingertip, forefoot and heel. No significant differences were found between the 
      thresholds for sinusoids representing notes between C1 and C6 when presented to 
      the fingertip of participants with normal hearing and with a severe or profound 
      hearing loss. For participants with normal hearing, thresholds for notes between 
      C1 and C6 showed the characteristic U-shape curve for the fingertip, but not for 
      the forefoot and heel. Compared to the fingertip, the forefoot had lower 
      thresholds between C1 and C3, and the heel had lower thresholds between C1 and 
      G2; this is attributed to spatial summation from the Pacinian receptors over the 
      larger contactor area used for the forefoot and heel. Participants with normal 
      hearing assessed the perception of high-frequency vibration using 1s sinusoids 
      presented to the fingertip and were found to be more aware of transient vibration 
      at the beginning and/or end of notes between G4 and C6 when stimuli were 
      presented 10dB above threshold, rather than at threshold. An average of 94% of 
      these participants reported feeling continuous vibration between G4 and G5 with 
      stimuli presented 10dB above threshold. Based on the experimental findings and 
      consideration of health effects relating to vibration exposure, a suitable range 
      of notes for vibrotactile presentation of music is identified as being from C1 to 
      G5. This is more limited than for human hearing but the fundamental frequencies 
      of the human voice, and the notes played by many instruments, lie within it. 
      However, the dynamic range might require compression to avoid the negative 
      effects of amplitude on pitch perception.

      of hearing loss on an individual who does not require a cochlear implant. Music 
      amplified through hearing aids has some interesting characteristics but high 
      fidelity is not typically one of them. This poses a serious problem for the 
      investigator who wants to perform research on music with hearing impaired 
      individuals who wear hearing aids. If the signal at the tympanic membrane is 
      somewhat distorted then this has consequences for the assessment of music 
      processing when examining both the peripheral and the central auditory system. In 
      this review article on the subject of hearing aids and music, some of the 
      acoustical differences between speech and music will be described. Following 
      this, a discussion about what hearing aids do well and also less well for music 
      as an input will be presented. Finally, some recommendations are made about what 
      can be done for hearing-impaired individuals who wear hearing aids to listen to 
      music.

TI  - [Medical problems of musicians].
PG  - A1143
AB  - Most individuals enjoy making music, but pleasure may be diminished by physical 
      complaints. The most common complaints in musicians include injuries of the upper 
      part of the body including the shoulder and spine, skin disorders and hearing 
      problems. Injuries are not so much related to the extent of rehearsing and 
      playing but are mostly the result of a wrong position and misuse of the 
      instrument. Adequate preparation before playing and professional coaching to 
      avoid injuries or to detect problems at an early stage are exceptions rather than 
      the rule. Because of the large number of amateur and professional musicians in 
      the Netherlands, music medicine deserves a more prominent role.

TI  - Effects of Including Information about Hidden Hearing Loss in an Adopt-A-Band 
      Program on College Band Members' Attitudes toward Healthy Hearing Behaviors.
PG  - 210-220
LID - 10.1055/s-0038-1641744 [doi]
AB  - Young musicians may be at risk for developing cochlear synaptopathy (CS), or 
      hidden hearing loss (HHL), that could lead to permanent music-induced hearing 
      loss (MIHL). Patients with CS often complain of tinnitus and/or difficulty 
      understanding speech in noisy situations, even though traditional audiometric 
      testing indicates normal hearing. The aim of this article was to determine the 
      effects of including information about HHL on an Adopt-A-Band program involving 
      college band members' concern about and self-efficacy toward the prevention of 
      MIHL. We conducted a single-blinded, randomized clinical trial. Forty-eight band 
      members participated in this study. Band members were randomly assigned to two 
      Adopt-A-Band presentations, one with and one without information on HHL. 
      Including information about HHL had no effect on these band members' concerns 
      about and self-efficacy toward the prevention of MIHL. However, the Adopt-A-Band 
      program resulted in significantly increased concern for MIHL by 39.5% ( p 
       < 0.0001, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 25-54.2), self-efficacy in its 
      prevention by 79.1% ( p  < 0.0001, 95% CI: 66.9-91.2), and plans to use 
      musicians' earplugs while playing by 67.4% ( p  < 0.0001, 95% CI: 53.4-81.45). 
      Although inclusion of information about HHL did not have a significant effect, 
      the Adopt-A-Band program, in general, significantly increased the immediate 
      intent of these students to practice healthy hearing behaviors. Future research 
      is needed to determine the long-term effects of using the Adopt-A-Band program 
      with university marching bands' use of healthy hearing behaviors.

TI  - Medical Issues in Playing the Oboe: A Literature Review.
PG  - 235-246
LID - 10.21091/mppa.2017.4040 [doi]
AB  - Playing a musical instrument can affect physical and mental health. A literature 
      review was conducted to determine the prevalence of health problems among 
      oboists, which medical conditions can be caused or exacerbated by playing, 
      whether oboe playing can be a protective factor, and whether recommendations are 
      possible as to who should or should not play the oboe. Searches in 7 databases 
      (Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, SocIndex, PsyIndex, 
      Psychinfo) yielded a total of 950 studies; after exclusion of duplicates and 
      those not meeting eligibility criteria, 37 articles were selected for final 
      analysis. In addition, Google Scholar and a musicology library served as 
      additional sources, revealing another 6 publications for inclusion. As a result, 
      some evidence was found for musculoskeletal problems, focal dystonia, stress 
      velopharyngeal incompetence, increased intraocular pressure and glaucoma, 
      gastroesophageal reflux disease, lower pulmonary function, disease transmission 
      via instruments, and hearing loss due to noise exposure. Playing the oboe may be 
      protective against obstructive sleep apnea. However, due to small sample sizes, 
      uncertain reproducibility of findings, and lack of accurate descriptions of 
      problems reported by oboists, far more evidence would be necessary to answer the 
      research questions conclusively. There was no evidence for causal relationships, 
      and thus no recommendations can be made regarding who should (not) play the oboe. 
      To improve the quality of medical care for these musicians and to implement 
      prevention strategies, future investigations with more in-depth 
      instrument-specific analyses and higher numbers of participants are needed.

AB  - The ENT physician and specialist in musician's medicine is consistently 
      confronted with the issue of hearing protection, since musicians exposed to high 
      sound levels due to their profession, and who are often concerned about their 
      hearing, refer to him. Furthermore, this topic has gained more relevance since a 
      noise exposure limit for professional musicians was issued in February 2008 by 
      the EC guidelines for occupational health and safety regarding "Noise" 
      (2003/10/EC). The present article gives an outline of the recent state of 
      knowledge about sound pressure levels, hearing risks, as well as the use of 
      hearing protection for musicians.

TI  - Surrounded by Sound: The Impact of Tinnitus on Musicians.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph18179036 [doi]
LID - 9036
AB  - AIM: To investigate the impact of tinnitus on professional musicians in the UK. 
      BACKGROUND: Tinnitus is the experience of sound when an external source is 
      absent, primarily associated with the ageing process, hearing loss, and noise 
      exposure. Amongst populations exposed to industrial noise, noise exposure and 
      noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) have been found to be the factors most 
      associated with tinnitus. The risk of NIHL amongst professional musicians is 
      greater than that amongst the general population, meaning they may be at 
      increased risk of tinnitus. METHODS: Seventy-four professional musicians 
      completed an online survey involving closed and open-ended questions, and 
      completed the Tinnitus fuctional Index (TFI) questionnaire. Descriptive 
      statistics and thematic analysis of open-ended qualitative responses were used to 
      analyse the data. RESULTS: Three themes were generated from the analysis of the 
      responses to the open-ended questions. These themes were: (1) the impact of 
      tinnitus on the lives of professional musicians, (2) professional musician 
      experience of tinnitus services, support, and hearing health and safety, and (3) 
      the support professional musicians want. The mean global TFI score for 
      professional musicians was 39.05, interpreted as tinnitus being a moderate 
      problem. Comparisons with general population data revealed lower TFI scores for 
      the TFI subscales of 'sense of control' and 'intrusiveness' for professional 
      musicians and higher for auditory difficulties associated with tinnitus amongst 
      professional musicians. CONCLUSION: Tinnitus can negatively impact on 
      professional musicians' lives. There is a need for bespoke self-help groups, 
      awareness raising, and education to prevent tinnitus and promote hearing health 
      among musicians.

TI  - Musicians' Hearing Handicap Index: A New Questionnaire to Assess the Impact of 
      Hearing Impairment in Musicians and Other Music Professionals.
PG  - 4219-4237
LID - 10.1044/2020_JSLHR-19-00165 [doi]
AB  - Purpose We aimed to develop and validate the Musicians' Hearing Handicap Index 
      (MHHI), a new self-evaluation tool for quantifying occupation-related auditory 
      difficulties in music professionals. Although pure-tone audiometry is often 
      considered the "gold standard" and is usually employed as the main instrument for 
      hearing assessment, it cannot fully describe the impact of hearing dysfunction. 
      The MHHI is an attempt to complement the hearing impairment assessment toolbox 
      and is based on a unique approach to quantify the effects of hearing-related 
      symptoms or hearing loss on the performance of musicians and other music industry 
      professionals. Method An initial set of 143 questionnaire items was successively 
      refined through a series of critical appraisals, modifications, and suggestions. 
      This yielded an intermediate questionnaire consisting of 43 items, which was 
      administered to 204 musicians and sound engineers. After exploratory factor 
      analysis, the final form of the MHHI questionnaire was obtained, consisting of 29 
      items. The questionnaire's test-retest reliability, internal consistency, 
      discriminating power, content validity, criterion validity, and aspects of 
      construct validity and inherent conceptual structure were assessed. Results 
      Exploratory factor analysis revealed a combination of four common factors for the 
      29 validated questionnaire items. They were named "impact on social and working 
      lives," "difficulties in performance and sound perception," "communication 
      difficulties," and "emotional distress." The MHHI was shown to be a valid and 
      reliable instrument to assess musicians' and sound engineers' occupational 
      difficulties due to hearing impairment and related symptoms. Conclusion The 
      ability of the MHHI to discriminate between groups of music professionals with 
      different auditory symptoms or pure-tone audiometry thresholds suggests that 
      auditory symptoms might influence a professional's performance to an extent that 
      cannot be assessed by a pure-tone audiogram.

AB  - Several factors indicate the possibility of sensorineural hearing loss in 
      connection with pop music. However, very few investigations have examined the 
      hearing in pop musicians and their audience. Sensorineural hearing loss was only 
      demonstrated in 5% of musicians. In our own material, we found a sensorineural 
      hearing loss in 13% defined as a mean pure-tone threshold at 3, 4, 6, and 8 kHz 
      of more than 20 dB HL. The hearing loss was, as expected, correlated with age, 
      duration of exposure, military service, etc. Temporary threshold shift 
      measurements showed that musicians were more resistant to pop music noise than 
      the audience and that female listeners were more resistant than male listeners. 
      The findings leave many interesting questions concerning the relationship between 
      noise and hearing loss.

      A Preliminary Study.

LID - 10.1159/000501154 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was aimed at determining the risk of developing 
      noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) in middle school band (MSB) and high school 
      band (HSB) members. METHOD: Between-group comparison of hearing thresholds. 
      Eleven MSB members and 6 MSNB controls, 20 HSB members and 5 HSNB controls. 
      RESULTS: Sixty-four percent of school-age band members presented with 15 dB HL or 
      greater notch at 4,000 or 6,000 Hz in at least one ear. The high school students 
      were slightly more likely to present with a notch. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate 
      that participation in band even as early as middle school increases the risk of 
      developing NIHL, and that the longer the participation the higher the risk. Steps 
      to insure hearing preservation in school-age band members are recommended.

TI  - A Qualitative Study of the Effects of Hearing Loss and Hearing Aid Use on Music 
      Perception in Performing Musicians.
PG  - 856-870
LID - 10.3766/jaaa.17019 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hearing aids (HAs) are important for the rehabilitation of 
      individuals with hearing loss. Although the rehabilitation of speech 
      communication is well understood, less attention has been devoted to 
      understanding hearing-impaired instrumentalists' needs to actively participate in 
      music. Despite efforts to adjust HA settings for music acoustics, there lacks an 
      understanding of instrumentalists' needs and if those HA adjustments satisfy 
      their needs. PURPOSE: The purpose of the current study was to explore the 
      challenges that adult HA-wearing instrumentalists face, which prevent them from 
      listening, responding to, and performing music. RESEARCH DESIGN: A qualitative 
      methodology was employed with the use of semistructured interviews conducted with 
      adult amateur instrumentalists. STUDY SAMPLE: Twelve HA users who were amateur 
      ensemble instrumentalists (playing instruments from the percussion, wind, reed, 
      brass, and string families) and between the ages of 55 and 83 years (seven men 
      and five women) provided data for analysis in this study. Amateur in this context 
      was defined as one who engaged mindfully in pursuit of an activity. DATA 
      COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Semistructured interviews were conducted using an 
      open-ended interview guide. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. 
      Transcripts were analyzed using conventional qualitative content analysis. 
      RESULTS: Three categories emerged from the data: (1) participatory needs, (2) 
      effects of HA use, and (3) effects of hearing loss. Participants primarily used 
      HAs to hear the conductor's instructions to meaningfully participate in music 
      rehearsals. Effects of HA use fell within two subcategories: HA music sound 
      quality and use of an HA music program. The effects of hearing loss fell within 
      three subcategories: inability to identify missing information, affected music 
      components, and nonauditory music perception strategies. CONCLUSIONS: Not 
      surprisingly, hearing-impaired instrumentalists face challenges participating in 
      their music activities. However, although participants articulated ways in which 
      HAs and hearing loss affect music perception, which in turn revealed perspectives 
      toward listening using the auditory system and other sensory systems, the primary 
      motivation for their HA use was the need to hear the conductor's directions. 
      These findings suggest that providing hearing-impaired instrumentalists access to 
      musical experience via participation should be prioritized above restoring the 
      perception of musical descriptors. Future research is needed with 
      instrumentalists who no longer listen to or perform music because of hearing 
      loss, so that the relationship between musical auditory deficiencies and 
      participation can be better explored.

TI  - Hearing loss in students at a conservatory.
PG  - 185-94
AB  - We tend not to think of music as noise but as a pleasant sound. Yet, played loud 
      enough, music can become a threat to the human ear. The question arises whether 
      professional musicians suffer from hearing losses caused by their playing of 
      music. The hearing of students at the Rotterdam conservatory was studied; medical 
      students served as a reference group. High percentages of audiometric noise dips 
      (16%) and high-frequency losses (20%) were found in students of the conservatory, 
      as well as a high percentage (72%) of extended high-frequency losses relative to 
      the reference curves of Dreschler et al. Surprisingly, an equally large (and in 
      the high-frequency region an even higher) percentage of hearing losses was found 
      in the control group of medical students with the same median age. In sum, the 
      exposure of conservatory students to the practice of music has as yet had no 
      effect on their hearing.

AB  - In this study, the physiological and perceptual correlates of auditory function 
      in student musicians and nonmusicians with normal hearing thresholds were 
      investigated. The measures involved were auditory brainstem responses as a 
      function of stimulation rate, spatial release from masking, and word intensity 
      rollover functions. The results indicated that as the stimulation rate was 
      increased, the wave I amplitude reductions were more abrupt in musicians than in 
      nonmusicians. However, no significant group differences were observed for speech 
      tasks. There were also no significant correlations between the results of speech 
      perception and the measures of peripheral neural function.

TI  - Musician earplugs: Appreciation and protection.
PG  - 198-208
LID - 10.4103/1463-1741.160688 [doi]
AB  - Recreational music exposure is a potential risk factor for noise-induced hearing 
      loss (NIHL). Augmented hearing protectors have been designed with modified 
      attenuation characteristics to combine hearing protection and listening comfort. 
      However, to date, only a few independent studies have assessed the performance of 
      those augmented protectors in realistic exposure conditions. This study compares 
      the listening experience and temporary effects on cochlear status with different 
      types of earplugs after exposure to contemporary club music. Five different types 
      of commercially available hearing protectors were worn, all commonly used during 
      leisure-time music exposure. Four of them were augmented premolded earplugs and 
      the fifth type was an inexpensive, standard earplug frequently distributed for 
      free at music events. During five different test sessions of 30 min each, 
      participants not professionally involved in music wore one particular type of 
      protector. Contemporary club music was played at sound pressure levels (SPLs) 
      representative of concerts and bars. After each listening session, a 
      questionnaire on sound quality and general appreciation was completed. In 
      addition, otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) were measured directly before and after 
      music exposure. The reported appreciation clearly differed depending on the 
      addressed characteristics and the specific earplug type. In this test group, the 
      reported appreciation mainly depended on comfort and looks, while differences in 
      sound quality were less noticeable. The changes in OAE amplitude before and after 
      noise exposure were small in terms of clinical standards. Nevertheless, the 
      observed temporary shifts differed systematically for the different types of 
      hearing protectors, with two types of musician earplug showing a more systematic 
      decline than the others. Further research with respect to actual use and achieved 
      protection for real, unsupervised music exposure is warranted.

TI  - Hearing loss among classical-orchestra musicians.
PG  - 45-50
LID - 10.4103/1463-1741.74001 [doi]
AB  - This study intended to evaluate classical musicians' risk of hearing loss. We 
      studied 63 musicians from four Helsinki classical orchestras. We measured their 
      hearing loss with an audiometer, found their prior amount of exposure to sound 
      and some individual susceptibility factors with a questionnaire, measured their 
      present sound exposure with dosimeters, and tested their blood pressure and 
      cholesterol levels, then compared their hearing loss to ISO 1999-1990's 
      predictions. The musicians' hearing loss distribution corresponded to that of the 
      general population, but highly exposed musicians had greater hearing loss at 
      frequencies over 3 kHz than less-exposed ones. Their individual susceptibility 
      factors were low. Music deteriorates hearing, but by less than what ISO 1999-1990 
      predicted. The low number of individual susceptibility factors explained the 
      difference, but only reduced hearing loss and not the prevalence of tinnitus.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Sensorineural hearing loss caused by exposure to noise is one of 
      the most frequent causes of deafness. Professional musicians have significant 
      occupational exposure to high levels of noise. Use of hearing protection among 
      musicians could substantially prevent hearing damage, though the rate of use is 
      quite low. METHODS AND MATERIAL: A questionnaire on the use of protective hearing 
      devices, hearing care, and subjective judgments of hearing difficulties was 
      completed by a group of classical musicians from Spain. We analysed the frequency 
      of device use by instrument based on contingency tables analysed by χ(2) tests. 
      RESULTS: One hundred and ninety-four Spanish classical orchestral musicians 
      voluntarily completed the questionnaire. The percentage of musicians who reported 
      using hearing protection in our survey was very low and varied with the type of 
      instrument played. However, we found a high prevalence of subjective auditory 
      disorders within this group. CONCLUSION: Few Spanish musicians use hearing 
      protection. Training on hearing-loss prevention in this field and better 
      protective devices could increase device use and improve the auditory health of 
      this group.

TI  - Effects of Musical Training and Hearing Loss on Fundamental Frequency 
      Discrimination and Temporal Fine Structure Processing: Psychophysics and 
      Modeling.
PG  - 263-277
LID - 10.1007/s10162-018-00710-2 [doi]
AB  - Several studies have shown that musical training leads to improved fundamental 
      frequency (F(0)) discrimination for young listeners with normal hearing (NH). It 
      is unclear whether a comparable effect of musical training occurs for listeners 
      whose sensory encoding of F(0) is degraded. To address this question, the effect 
      of musical training was investigated for three groups of listeners (young NH, 
      older NH, and older listeners with hearing impairment, HI). In a first 
      experiment, F(0) discrimination was investigated using complex tones that 
      differed in harmonic content and phase configuration (sine, positive, or negative 
      Schroeder). Musical training was associated with significantly better F(0) 
      discrimination of complex tones containing low-numbered harmonics for all groups 
      of listeners. Part of this effect was caused by the fact that musicians were more 
      robust than non-musicians to harmonic roving. Despite the benefit relative to 
      their non-musicians counterparts, the older musicians, with or without HI, 
      performed worse than the young musicians. In a second experiment, binaural 
      sensitivity to temporal fine structure (TFS) cues was assessed for the same 
      listeners by estimating the highest frequency at which an interaural phase 
      difference was perceived. Performance was better for musicians for all groups of 
      listeners and the use of TFS cues was degraded for the two older groups of 
      listeners. These findings suggest that musical training is associated with an 
      enhancement of both TFS cues encoding and F(0) discrimination in young and older 
      listeners with or without HI, although the musicians' benefit decreased with 
      increasing hearing loss. Additionally, models of the auditory periphery and 
      midbrain were used to examine the effect of HI on F(0) encoding. The model 
      predictions reflected the worsening in F(0) discrimination with increasing HI and 
      accounted for up to 80 % of the variance in the data.

TI  - Assessment of hearing and hearing disorders in rock/jazz musicians.
PG  - 279-88
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess hearing and hearing disorders among rock/jazz 
      musicians. One hundred and thirty-nine (43 women and 96 men) musicians 
      participated. The results are based on pure-tone audiometry and questionnaire 
      responses. According to our definition of hearing loss, tinnitus, hyperacusis, 
      distortion and/or diplacusis as hearing disorders, we found disorders in 74%, of 
      the rock/jazz musicians studied. Hearing loss, tinnitus and hyperacusis were most 
      common, and the latter two were found significantly more frequently than in 
      different reference populations. The women showed bilateral, significantly better 
      hearing thresholds at 3-6 kHz than the men. Hyperacusis, and the combination of 
      both hyperacusis and tinnitus, were found to be significantly more frequent among 
      women than among men. Hearing loss and tinnitus were significantly more common 
      among men than among women. It is important to evaluate all kinds of hearing 
      problems (other than hearing loss) in musicians, since they represent an 
      occupational group especially dependent on optimal, functional hearing. On the 
      basis of our results, we suggest that hearing problems such as tinnitus, 
      hyperacusis, distortion and/or diplacusis should, in addition to hearing loss, be 
      defined as hearing disorders.

TI  - Employment and acceptance of hearing protectors in classical symphony and opera 
      orchestras.
PG  - 14-26
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Prior to this study, it was not clear how familiar orchestral 
      musicians were with the various insertable models of hearing protectors. The 
      present study focuses on musicians and entertainers and proposes the maintenance 
      of a noise exposure limit through the use of a hearing protector. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: This study was conducted by distributing a questionnaire to musicians ( 
      n = 429) in nine orchestras in order to obtain information on the use of hearing 
      protection and the musicians' hearing sensitivity. RESULTS: Hearing protectors 
      were found to be seldom used by orchestral musicians. During orchestral 
      rehearsals, < 1/6 of the test persons used Type 1 (individually fitted) hearing 
      protectors although> 80% of the respondents indicated that they knew about them. 
      A gap emerged between what seemed most important to musicians in hearing 
      protectors and what was provided by the manufacturers. CONCLUSIONS: The subject 
      of hearing protection in orchestral musicians should be investigated with a 
      multidimensional approach which considers the following in equal measure: legal 
      regulations, the requirements and limits of the music sector and the individual 
      characteristics of the musicians involved.

TI  - Bassoonists' medical problems-current state of knowledge.
PG  - 107-12
AB  - Specific musical instruments can be a source of physical problems to their 
      players. Based on reviews of the literature and personal experience, this paper 
      summarizes current knowledge of problems affecting musicians who play instruments 
      in the bassoon family (including the bassoon, contrabassoon, and several other 
      instruments). Prevalence rates are higher in reports of surveys (ranging up to 
      86%), compared to clinical reports of patients seen and treated. Significant risk 
      factors include young age, small body size, female gender, and use of large 
      instruments. Problems unique to bassoonists are rare; most physical difficulties 
      also are seen in general musculoskeletal clinical practices and in musicians 
      playing all types of instruments. The left upper extremity is more commonly 
      affected by overuse-related conditions in bassoonists. Non-playing-related 
      problems are equally important for consideration (such as degenerative disorders 
      and acute trauma), since they also affect practice and performance. Little 
      experimental data exist to validate current and widely-held principles of 
      treatment, rehabilitation, and prevention.

TI  - Hearing conservation program for marching band members: a risk for noise-induced 
      hearing loss?
PG  - 26-39
LID - 10.1044/1059-0889(2012/11-0030) [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To examine the risk for noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) in university 
      marching band members and to provide an overview of a hearing conservation 
      program for a marching band. METHOD: Sound levels during band rehearsals were 
      recorded and audiometric hearing thresholds and transient otoacoustic emission 
      were measured over a 3-year period. Musician's earplugs and information about 
      hearing loss were provided to the students. The hearing thresholds of other 
      college students were tested as a partial control. RESULTS: There were no 
      significant differences in hearing thresholds between the two groups. During 
      initial testing, more marching band members showed apparent high-frequency 
      notches than control students. Follow-up hearing tests in a subsequent year for 
      the marching band members showed that almost all notches disappeared. Persistent 
      standard threshold shift (STS) across tests was not observed in the band members. 
      CONCLUSION: Band members showed no evidence of STS or persistent notched 
      audiograms. Because accepted procedures for measuring hearing showed a lack of 
      precision in reliably detecting early NIHL in marching band members, it is 
      recommended that signs of NIHL be sought in repeated measurements compared to 
      baseline audiograms rather than in a single measure (a single notch). A hearing 
      conservation program for this population is still recommended because of lengthy 
      rehearsal times with high sound-level exposure during rehearsals.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess hearing of music students in 
      relation to their exposure to excessive sounds. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Standard 
      pure-tone audiometry (PTA) was performed in 168 music students, aged 22.5±2.5 
      years. The control group included 67 subjects, non-music students and 
      non-musicians, aged 22.8±3.3 years. Data on the study subjects' musical 
      experience, instruments in use, time of weekly practice and additional risk 
      factors for noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) were identified by means of a 
      questionnaire survey. Sound pressure levels produced by various groups of 
      instruments during solo and group playing were also measured and analyzed. The 
      music students' audiometric hearing threshold levels (HTLs) were compared with 
      the theoretical predictions calculated according to the International 
      Organization for Standardization standard ISO 1999:2013. RESULTS: It was 
      estimated that the music students were exposed for 27.1±14.3 h/week to sounds at 
      the A-weighted equivalent-continuous sound pressure level of 89.9±6.0 dB. There 
      were no significant differences in HTLs between the music students and the 
      control group in the frequency range of 4000-8000 Hz. Furthermore, in each group 
      HTLs in the frequency range 1000-8000 Hz did not exceed 20 dB HL in 83% of the 
      examined ears. Nevertheless, high frequency notched audiograms typical of the 
      noise-induced hearing loss were found in 13.4% and 9% of the musicians and 
      non-musicians, respectively. The odds ratio (OR) of notching in the music 
      students increased significantly along with higher sound pressure levels (OR = 
      1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.014-1.13, p < 0.05). The students' HTLs 
      were worse (higher) than those of a highly screened non-noise-exposed population. 
      Moreover, their hearing loss was less severe than that expected from sound 
      exposure for frequencies of 3000 Hz and 4000 Hz, and it was more severe in the 
      case of frequency of 6000 Hz. CONCLUSIONS: The results confirm the need for 
      further studies and development of a hearing conservation program for music 
      students. Int J Occup Med Environ Health 2017;30(1):55-75.

AB  - Accurate and objective assessment of higher order auditory processing is 
      challenging and mainly relies on evaluations that require a subjects' active 
      participation in tests such as frequency discrimination or speech perception in 
      noise. This study investigates the value of cortical auditory evoked potentials 
      (CAEPs) evoked in response to auditory change stimuli, known as acoustic change 
      complexes (ACCs), as an objective measurement of auditory performance in hearing 
      impairment. Secondary objectives were to assess the effect of hearing loss and 
      non-professional musical experience on the ACC, and compare the ACC to the 
      'conventional' CAEP evoked in response to stimulus onset. In 24 normal-hearing 
      subjects, consisting of 12 musicians and 12 non-musicians, and 13 age-matched 
      hearing-impaired subjects ACCs were recorded in response to 12% frequency 
      increases at four base frequencies (0.5, 1, 2 and 4 kHz). ACC amplitudes and 
      latencies were compared to frequency discrimination thresholds at each base 
      frequency, and to speech perception in noise. Frequency discrimination and speech 
      perception in noise were significantly better for larger ACC N1-P2 amplitudes and 
      shorter N1 latencies, whereas both frequency discrimination and speech perception 
      did not correlate with onset CAEP amplitude or latency. Multiple regression 
      analysis for prediction of speech perception in noise revealed that the strongest 
      model was obtained by averaging over three frequencies (1, 2 and 4 kHz) with two 
      significant predictors: hearing loss (R(2) = 0.52) and ACC latency (R(2) = 0.35). 
      Thus, explaining 87% of the variance, this model indicates that subjects with 
      longer ACC latencies have worse speech perception in noise than subjects with 
      comparable hearing thresholds and shorter ACC latencies. If hearing loss was 
      removed from this model, the combination of ACC amplitude and latency over those 
      three frequencies explained 74% of the total variance in speech perception in 
      noise. There were no differences in frequency discrimination, speech perception, 
      CAEP, or ACC between recreational musicians and non-musicians. We conclude that 
      the objective ACC N1 latency is a good predictor of speech perception in noise. 
      When confirmed in validation studies with larger numbers of subjects, it can aid 
      clinicians in their evaluation of auditory performance and higher order 
      processing, in particular when behavioral testing is unreliable.

AB  - The occurrence of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) can be detrimental to the 
      future careers of student musicians. Few studies have focused on the noise 
      exposure of student musicians within an indoor pep band as they performed during 
      university basketball games. The purpose of this longitudinal study was to 
      assess: (a) the status of noise dosages acquired via personal noise dosimeters 
      from two pep band players as they performed over nine men's basketball games 
      spanning three seasons, (b) perceived effectiveness of earplugs on the primary 
      participants, and (c) the status of all band members' (n=72) knowledge of hearing 
      loss and hearing loss prevention. The noise dosages accrued by primary 
      participants in each game over the three seasons greatly exceeded the National 
      Institute for Occupational Safety and Health's (NIOSH) recommendation regarding 
      safe daily noise exposure time. Participants occasionally reported that the 
      earplugs did not provide sufficient protection from noise or contributed to 
      communication and intonation issues. Questionnaire responses from band members 
      demonstrated a mild deficiency in hearing loss knowledge. Two-thirds of pep band 
      members reported that they did not always wear hearing protection at pep band 
      functions. Exceeding standard noise dosage recommendations without hearing 
      protection potentially leaves these individuals at a high risk for permanent 
      hearing loss.

AB  - Professional musicians are at high risk of developing tinnitus due to their 
      over-exposure to music at both occupational and recreational level. This is a 
      5-year long prospective case series study performed in the Musicians/Performing 
      Arts Medicine Clinic of the 1st Otorhinolaryngology Department of the National 
      and Kapodistrian University of Athens. A total of 274 professional musicians 
      underwent thorough medical history, history of music exposure, assessment of the 
      impact their hearing status has on their professional life (Musicians Hearing 
      Handicap Index), behavioral (Pure Tone Audiometry, standard and extended high 
      frequency) and objective audiometric tests (TEOAE and DPOAE). Standard pure tone 
      audiometry thresholds were correlated with the presence of tinnitus only at high 
      frequencies. Musicians with tinnitus had a clinical and significant higher MHHI 
      score and the incidence of tinnitus was significantly higher in participants 
      suffering from musculoskeletal disease and those with abnormal PTA. Participants' 
      hours of practice were similar in those with tinnitus and those without. The 
      tinnitus group (and in order of descending effect size) had significantly worse 
      thresholds in high frequency audiometry (≥3000Hz) as well as lower signal to 
      noise ratios in DPOAE at almost all frequencies and in TEOAE at high frequencies 
      (2.8 and 4kHz). A subgroup analysis of the musicians with normal PTA, showed that 
      those with tinnitus showed elevated thresholds in the extended high frequency. In 
      conclusion, tinnitus occurrence in musicians with normal audiogram is potentially 
      correlated with high frequency hearing loss and impaired otoacoustic emissions 
      and these two examinations should be considered in this group.

TI  - Health problems in musicians--a review.
PG  - 247-51
AB  - Among artists, musicians suffer from special health problems related to their 
      occupation and lifestyle. These mainly include musculoskeletal disorders, skin 
      disorders, respiratory disorders, and noise induced hearing impairment. In this 
      review we point out the most prevalent health problems that musicians face in 
      their professional lives as well as the means to prevent them. The 
      characteristics of individual performer and the type of instrument that he/she 
      plays will determine the occupational disorder or disease that a musician may 
      suffer from. The main worry about health problems in musicians is that they can 
      become potentially career-ending disabilities. Therefore well-planned preventive 
      strategies should be employed to help musicians in obtaining long and healthy 
      career.

TI  - Hearing loss in British Army musicians.
PG  - 281-3
LID - 10.1093/occmed/kqt026 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Military musicians increasingly fulfil front line roles. Existing 
      literature suggests that musicians are at greater risk of hearing loss than the 
      general population. It is important to ascertain whether these findings apply to 
      military musicians if they are to be placed in operational acoustically hazardous 
      environments. AIMS: To compare hearing loss between groups of British Army 
      musicians and with their administrative (non-musician) counterparts. METHODS: 
      Routine health surveillance audiometric data for a group of military musicians 
      were compared with military administrative staff during the first 8-12 years of 
      their careers. Structured interviews were used to identify those meeting the 
      study inclusion criteria (8 year minimum service, no significant, relevant 
      medical history, no previous extraordinary loud noise exposure, service within 
      study employment group throughout military career), and to clarify the instrument 
      played. RESULTS: Eighty-four musicians and 44 administrators participated. Using 
      the Health & Safety Executive's (HSE's) age- and gender-correcting system, 12 
      (14%) musicians and 9 (20%) non-musicians had a deterioration in hearing. The 
      overall odds ratio for developing hearing loss in musicians was 0.65 (95% CI 
      0.25-1.68). Compared with woodwind instrumentalists, the odds ratio for hearing 
      loss in brass instrumentalists was 2.00 (95% CI 0.85-3.44) and for percussionists 
      1.83 (95% CI 0.77-2.90). CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that military 
      musicians are at no greater risk of hearing loss than their administrative 
      counterparts after 8-12 years in service. This may represent a healthy-worker 
      effect. There is no statistically significant differential risk of hearing loss 
      between different instrumental groups.

PG  - 198

LID - 198
AB  - Music induced hearing loss (MIHL) is linked to chronic, extended exposure, and 
      progress at a rate proportionate to exposure conditions. The aim was to document 
      hearing deterioration; awareness of ear protection devices (EPDs); presence of 
      tinnitus, measurement of temporary threshold shift. Thirty-four musicians filled 
      a questionnaire regarding: years of experience, instrument/splayed, hours of 
      music exposure per week with/without amplification, through earphones and 
      speakers, use of EPDs and tinnitus. Hearing screening in five subjects was done 
      before and after one hour and ten minutes of practice session. Among the 
      participants, 8.8% reported hearing deterioration subjectively and 38.2% reported 
      unilateral intermittent tinnitus, 79.4% lacked awareness about EPDs and 21.6 % 
      were aware but never used them. Mean for temporary threshold shift at 500 Hz and 
      1 KHz was 5dB HL and 10dBHL at 2 KHz. Musicians are at risk for hearing problems, 
      but the awareness on auditory damage is limited, hence conservative measures must 
      be taken for their well being.

AB  - Experimental and epidemiological research indicate an association between 
      long-term stress and hearing problems, yet the mechanisms underlying these 
      disorders are not yet fully established. Thus, in order to better understand the 
      pathogenesis of stress-related hearing problems, the present study explored the 
      symptoms and general physiological and psychosocial status of musicians in 
      symphony orchestras. Orchestral musicians are an ideal group to study since 
      physical, psychosocial, work-environmental and acoustic stressors are highly 
      prevalent. The subjects where obtained from two different studies. The first 
      group included 250 participants from 12 orchestras and is entitled "the 
      epidemiological study". The second group, entitled "the longitudinal study", 
      included 47 musicians who were assessed at five occasions (every half year) 
      during two years. Thirty-one of the 47 participants were selected for sampling of 
      physiological variables, i.e. 24-hour ECG to assess heart rate variability to 
      evaluate the synergistic action of the autonomic system as well as saliva 
      cortisol and testosterone levels. The results indicate that self-reported hearing 
      problems are associated with perceived poorer psychosocial environment, as well 
      as mental health symptoms and stress. High-frequency power of heart rate 
      variability (parasympathetic activity) showed a negative relationship to hearing 
      problems, implying a poorer ability to "unwind" from stress. Cortisol levels were 
      not correlated to hearing problems whereas testosterone levels showed a tendency 
      to be lower in subjects with hearing problems than in others. These findings 
      provide evidence for a relationship between long-term stress and self-reported 
      hearing problems and demonstrate a protective role of parasympathetic and 
      anabolic activity on hearing status.

TI  - Evaluation of sound exposure and risk of hearing impairment in orchestral 
      musicians.
PG  - 255-69
AB  - This study aimed to assess exposure to sound and the risk of noise-induced 
      hearing loss (NIHL) in orchestral musicians. Sound pressure level was measured in 
      1 opera and 3 symphony orchestras; questionnaires were filled in. On the basis of 
      that data, the risk of NIHL was assessed according to Standard No. ISO 1999:1990. 
      Classical orchestral musicians are usually exposed to sound at equivalent 
      continuous A-weighted sound pressure levels of 81?90 dB (10th?90th percentiles), 
      for 20?45 h (10th?90th percentiles) per week. Occupational exposure to such sound 
      levels over 40 years of employment might cause hearing loss (expressed as a mean 
      hearing threshold level at 2, 3, 4 kHz exceeding 35 dB) of up to 26%. Playing the 
      horn, trumpet, tuba and percussion carries the highest risk (over 20%).

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Research has shown that hearing loss in musicians may cause 
      difficulty in timbre recognition and tuning of instruments. AIM: To analyze the 
      hearing thresholds from 250 Hz to 16,000 Hz in a group of music students and 
      compare them to a non-musician group in order to determine whether high-frequency 
      audiometry is a useful tool in the early detection of hearing impairment. 
      METHODS: Study design was a retrospective observational cohort. Conventional and 
      high-frequency audiometry was performed in 42 music students (Madsen Itera II 
      audiometer and TDH39P headphones for conventional audiometry, and HDA 200 
      headphones for high-frequency audiometry). RESULTS: Of the 42 students, 38.1% 
      were female students and 61.9% were male students, with a mean age of 26 years. 
      At conventional audiometry, 92.85% had hearing thresholds within normal limits; 
      but even within the normal limits, the worst results were observed in the left 
      ear for all frequencies, except for 4000 Hz; compared to the non-musician group, 
      the worst results occurred at 500 Hz in the left ear, and at 250 Hz, 6000 Hz, 
      9000 Hz, 10,000 Hz, and 11,200 Hz in both the ears. CONCLUSION: The periodic 
      evaluation of high-frequency thresholds may be useful in the early detection of 
      hearing loss in musicians.

TI  - Acoustic sensitivity of the saccule and daf music.
PG  - 105-10
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The daf is a large Persian frame drum used as a musical instrument 
      in both popular and classical music which can induce a percussive sound at low 
      frequencies (146-290 Hz) with peaks of up to 130 dBspl. The percussive sounds 
      have a power distribution in the region of saccular sensitivity. In view of the 
      saccular stimulation by sound in humans, we decided to use cervical 
      vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials (cVEMPs) to evaluate the possibility that 
      the daf music may have a disturbing effect on saccular function. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: During this case-control study, 18 daf musicians were compared with 20 
      healthy individuals evaluated in the audiology department of the Hamadan 
      University of Medical Sciences. Assessment consisted of pure tone audiometry, 
      tympanometry, and cVEMPs. RESULTS: Multiple comparisons of mean the cVEMPs and 
      mean hearing loss at 250 Hz among the three groups (affected, unaffected, and 
      normal ears) were significant. There were no significant differences between all 
      daf players on high-tone loss at 3000 Hz. The daf musicians had bilateral 
      unsymmetrical sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), with hearing loss at 250 Hz 
      (low-tone loss) and notched audiogram at 3000 Hz (high-tone loss). Eleven 
      musicians with decreased vestibular excitability as detected by abnormal cVEMPs 
      had mild (26-40 dBHL) low-tone loss and significant abnormal cVEMPs findings. In 
      contrast, the others had slight (16-25 dBHL) low-tone loss with normal cVEMPs. 
      Exposure to daf music is related to both saccular and cochlear dysfunction. 
      CONCLUSION: Exposure to daf music is related to both saccular and cochlear 
      dysfunction.

TI  - Incidence and relative risk of hearing disorders in professional musicians.
PG  - 472-6
LID - 10.1136/oemed-2014-102172 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hearing disorders have been associated with occupational exposure to 
      music. Musicians may benefit from non-amplified and low-intensity music, but may 
      also have high risks of music-induced hearing loss. AIMS: To compare the 
      incidence of hearing loss (HL) and its subentities in professional musicians with 
      that in the general population. METHODS: We performed a historical cohort study 
      among insurants between 19 and 66 years who were employed subject to social 
      insurance contributions. The study was conducted with data from three German 
      statutory health insurance providers covering the years 2004-2008 with about 7 
      million insurants. Incidence rates with 95% CIs of HL and the subentities 
      noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL), conductive HL, sensorineural HL, conductive 
      and sensorineural HL, as well as tinnitus were estimated stratified by age, sex 
      and federal state. A Cox regression analysis was conducted to estimate adjusted 
      HRs and two-sided 95% CIs for HL and its subentities. RESULTS: More than 3 
      million insurants were eligible, of whom 2227 were identified as professional 
      musicians (0.07%). During the 4-year observation period, 283,697 cases of HL were 
      seen, 238 of them among professional musicians (0.08%), leading to an unadjusted 
      incidence rate ratio of 1.27. The adjusted hazard ratio of musicians was 1.45 
      (95% CI 1.28 to 1.65) for HL and 3.61 (95% CI 1.81 to 7.20) for NIHL. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Professional musicians have a high risk of contracting hearing 
      disorders. Use of already available prevention measures should reduce the 
      incidence of HL in professional musicians.

TI  - Hearing conservation and noise management practices in professional orchestras.
PG  - 602-8
LID - 10.1080/15459624.2012.715519 [doi]
AB  - Hearing conservation and noise exposure management for professional orchestras is 
      a difficult issue resistant to standard control measures as used in other 
      industries with excessive noise problems. Although there has been a great deal of 
      research into this area in terms of the audiological status of musicians and 
      their exposure to noise, there are relatively few industry-specific strategies 
      that can be adopted by an orchestra looking to address these issues. Australia 
      does not have a uniform approach to hearing conservation management in its 
      orchestras; however, each orchestra actively grapples with the challenges of 
      balancing legal, practical, and artistic concerns. This study systematically 
      investigated hearing conservation practices, noise exposure management, and 
      audiological screening protocols in eight professional orchestras. The research 
      involved personal interviews with staff at each orchestra, including inspection 
      of venues and facilities. While all these orchestras were aware of the risks and 
      were actively taking significant steps to reduce noise exposure, a range of 
      approaches, with varying degrees of effectiveness and understanding of the issue, 
      were found across the sector. There was limited evidence of educational programs 
      for either the musicians at risk of excessive noise exposure or the staff 
      responsible for devising and implementing control measures. In addition, the 
      reported use of adequate personal hearing protection by musicians was poor. As 
      Australia has recently introduced a national approach to workplace health and 
      safety, a similar approach to noise and audiological management across the 
      country's orchestral sector is proposed, drawn from existing research and 
      practice. This will enable both consistent procedures and meaningful dialogue 
      between the orchestras on the topics of hearing conservation, audiological 
      monitoring, and educational practices.

TI  - Noise-induced hearing loss and orchestral musicians.
PG  - 761-4
AB  - Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is well reported among devotees of rock 'n' 
      roll music, but less attention has been focused on players of orchestral music. 
      Sound pressure levels have been recorded from within orchestras during 
      performances, and audiometry has been carried out on orchestral musicians. 
      Short-lasting peaks of sound of high amplitude were found to occur, and some 
      players had audiometric changes consistent with NIHL. However, in practice, there 
      seemed to be no threat to the players' continued livelihood, although the 
      additive effect of presbyacusis in later life poses a potential problem. The 
      difficulties of prevention of NIHL and the attenuation of the high sound levels 
      of orchestras do not seem to be completely soluble.

AB  - Purpose The aim of this study was to determine the long-term associations of 
      musical training with speech perception in adverse conditions and cognition in a 
      longitudinal cohort study of middle-age to older adults. Method This study is 
      based on Epidemiology of Hearing Loss Study participants. We asked participants 
      at baseline (1993-1995) about their musical training. Speech perception (word 
      recognition in competing message; Northwestern University Auditory Test Number 
      6), cognitive function (cognitive test battery), and impairment (self-report or 
      surrogate report of Alzheimer's disease or dementia, and/or a Mini-Mental State 
      Examination score ≤ 24) were assessed up to 5 times over the 20-year follow-up. 
      We included 2,938 Epidemiology of Hearing Loss Study participants who had musical 
      training data and at least one follow-up of speech perception and/or cognitive 
      assessment. We used linear mixed-effects models to determine associations between 
      musicianship and decline in speech perception and cognitive function over time 
      and Cox regression models to evaluate associations of musical training with 
      20-year cumulative incidence of speech perception and cognitive impairment. 
      Models were adjusted for age, sex, and occupation and repeated with additional 
      adjustment for health-related confounders and education. Results Musicians showed 
      less speech perception decline over time with stronger effects in women (0.16% 
      difference, 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.05, 0.26]). Among men, musicians had, 
      on average, better speech perception than nonmusicians (3.41% difference, 95% CI 
      [0.62, 6.20]) and were less likely to develop a cognitive impairment than 
      nonmusicians (hazard ratio = 0.58, 95% CI [0.37, 0.91]). Conclusions Musicians 
      showed an advantage in speech perception abilities and cognition later in life 
      and less decline over time with different magnitudes of effect sizes in men and 
      women. Associations remained with further adjustment, indicating that some degree 
      of the advantage of musical training is independent of socioeconomic or health 
      differences. If confirmed, these findings could have implications for developing 
      speech perception intervention and prevention strategies. Supplemental Material

TI  - [Rock music and hearing disorders].
PG  - 874-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Continued exposition to loud noise is a well-known risk factor for 
      development of various hearing disorders; rock musicians are especially 
      vulnerable. The aim of this paper was to get an overview of hearing loss, 
      tinnitus and hyperacusis among rock musicians. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Medline was 
      systematically searched, using combinations of the terms "hearing", "rock music", 
      "tinnitus" and "hyperacusis". RESULTS AND INTERPRETATION: Seven publications 
      concerning hearing of rock musicians were identified. Permanent hearing loss 
      occurred in 20% (mean) of the rock musicians; the prevalence varied from 5 to 
      41%. Tinnitus and hyperacusis appear significantly more often in rock musicians 
      than in non-musicians. Rock musicians have increased resistance against loud 
      music and exposure over time is protective towards hearing loss. Further research 
      is needed to assess rock music's impact on musicians' hearing.

TI  - Hearing loss in relation to sound exposure of professional symphony orchestra 
      musicians.
PG  - 448-60
LID - 10.1097/AUD.0000000000000029 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to: (1) estimate the hearing status 
      of classical symphony orchestra musicians and (2) investigate the hypothesis that 
      occupational sound exposure of symphony orchestra musicians leads to elevated 
      hearing thresholds. DESIGN: The study population comprised all the musicians from 
      five symphony orchestras. Questionnaires were filled in by 337 subjects, and 212 
      subjects performed an audiometric test. For a group of 182 musicians (363 ears) 
      the results of the audiometry was analyzed in relation to the individual 
      exposure, which was estimated on the basis of sound measurements and 
      questionnaire data regarding the exposure time. The mean hearing threshold at the 
      frequencies 3, 4, and 6 kHz, corrected for age and sex, was used as outcome. 
      RESULTS: The musician ears with the highest exposure (29 of 363) had an 
      additional threshold shift of 6.3 dB compared with the 238 ears with lowest 
      exposure. The observed hearing loss of musicians was smaller compared with the 
      noise-induced permanent threshold shift (NIPTS) predicted from ISO1999. A 
      remaining confounding effect of age after ISO7029 age corrections could be 
      observed to explain the difference in observed and predicted NIPTS. However, the 
      observed hearing loss difference between the left and the right ear of musicians 
      was 2.5 dB (95% confidence interval 1.5-3.6), which was similar to the NIPTS 
      predicted from ISO1999. Most of the musicians had better hearing at 3, 4, and 6 
      kHz for age than expected, however, 29 ears with the highest exposure above 90.4 
      dBA with a mean exposure time of 41.7 years had significantly elevated hearing 
      thresholds. Trumpet players and the left ear of first violinists had 
      significantly elevated hearing thresholds compared with other musicians. 
      CONCLUSION: Most of the symphony orchestra musicians had better hearing than 
      expected but they had a work-related risk of developing additional noise-induced 
      hearing loss. The additional NITPS of the left ear compared with the right ear 
      was at the expected level based on the cumulated sound exposure and ISO1999, 
      indicating that performing music may induce hearing loss to the same extent as 
      industrial noise.

TI  - The audiological health of horn players.
PG  - 590-6
LID - 10.1080/15459624.2013.818227 [doi]
AB  - Among orchestral musicians, horn players are one of the most at-risk groups for 
      noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). To investigate this group further, pure tone 
      audiometry and a 14-item questionnaire were used to assess the hearing health, as 
      well as attitudes and practices regarding hearing conservation, among 142 French 
      horn players attending an international horn conference in Brisbane, Australia. 
      Of this study's French horn players, 11.1% to 22.2%, and 17.7% to 32.9% of those 
      aged ≤40 years, showed some form of hearing loss (corrected for age and gender) 
      typical of NIHL, using conservative versus lenient criteria, respectively. 
      Stepwise multiple regression analyses showed no obvious predictor of hearing loss 
      in this study's participants. Of the 18% of participants who reported using 
      hearing protection, 81% used this protection "sometimes" and 50% used generic, 
      foam, or other inferior forms of protection. Continued efforts to better manage 
      the hearing health of horn players is warranted particularly as any hearing loss 
      will affect a horn player's ability to perform and therefore his or her 
      livelihood. Managing the hearing health of horn players will be challenging, 
      however, with no simple predictor of NIHL loss being identified in this study's 
      sample.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to establish whether preferred music-listening 
      level differed between musicians and non-musicians, and whether preferred 
      music-listening level was related to music genre preference and lifetime noise 
      exposure. Seventeen musicians (mean age = 29.06 years, SD = 4.74; female n = 9) 
      and 17 non-musicians (mean age = 28.94 years, SD = 4.63; female n = 9) with 
      clinically normal hearing were recruited to listen to six music samples from 
      different genres and one sample of environmental sounds. Participants adjusted 
      the listening level [dB(A)] until the music was loud and enjoyable. This was 
      repeated three times and an average was taken. Lifetime noise exposure was 
      estimated using the Noise Exposure Structured Interview. Preferred 
      music-listening levels of musicians were significantly higher than non-musicians. 
      The preferred music-listening level differed with genre preference, with the 
      participants' favorite tracks being played at 11 dB higher level than the least 
      favorite tracks. There was also a positive correlation between lifetime noise 
      exposure and preferred music-listening level. Musicians prefer to listen to music 
      at higher level than non-musicians and thus may be more susceptible to noise 
      induced hearing loss than non-musicians. As such, musicians in particular would 
      benefit from simple changes in lifestyle and listening habits, including 
      increased awareness of the risks of higher listening levels, as well as the use 
      of hearing protection.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To test the hypothesis that noise exposure may cause hearing loss in 
      classical musicians. DESIGN: Comparison of hearing levels between two risk groups 
      identified during the study by measuring sound levels. SETTING: Symphony 
      orchestra and occupational health department in the west Midlands. MAIN OUTCOME 
      MEASURES: Hearing level as measured by clinical pure tone audiometry. RESULTS: 
      Trumpet and piccolo players received a noise dose of 160% and 124%, respectively, 
      over mean levels during part of the study. Comparison of the hearing levels of 18 
      woodwind and brass musicians with 18 string musicians matched for age and sex did 
      not show a significant difference in hearing, the mean difference in the hearing 
      levels at the high (2, 4, and 8 KHz) audiometric frequencies being 1.02 dB (95% 
      confidence interval -2.39 to 4.43). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that there is 
      a potential for occupational hearing loss in classical orchestral musicians.

TI  - Music and hearing aids--an introduction.
PG  - 136-9
LID - 10.1177/1084713812468512 [doi]
AB  - Modern digital hearing aids have provided improved fidelity over those of earlier 
      decades for speech. The same however cannot be said for music. Most modern 
      hearing aids have a limitation of their "front end," which comprises the 
      analog-to-digital (A/D) converter. For a number of reasons, the spectral nature 
      of music as an input to a hearing aid is beyond the optimal operating conditions 
      of the "front end" components. Amplified music tends to be of rather poor 
      fidelity. Once the music signal is distorted, no amount of software manipulation 
      that occurs later in the circuitry can improve things. The solution is not a 
      software issue. Some characteristics of music that make it difficult to be 
      transduced without significant distortion include an increased sound level 
      relative to that of speech, and the crest factor- the difference in dB between 
      the instantaneous peak of a signal and its RMS value. Clinical strategies and 
      technical innovations have helped to improve the fidelity of amplified music and 
      these include a reduction of the level of the input that is presented to the A/D 
      converter.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Military musicians are working in a noisy environment with high sound 
      exposure levels above the international standards. Aim of the current study is to 
      find out, whether they develop the expected hearing impairments. Adherence to the 
      regulations for prevention in musicians is more difficult than in other 
      occupational fields. METHODS: In an interval of 13.3 years, 36 out of 58 male 
      military musicians of a German army music corps were subjected twice to an 
      audiometric audit. There were no exclusion criteria apart from acute ENT 
      infections (three musicians). These results were compared with one another and 
      evaluated by means of statistical methods for relationships with several factors. 
      RESULTS: At frequencies below 3 kHz, the follow-up audiograms were up to 5 dB 
      better than the preliminary examination. From 4 kHz up to 8 kHz the preliminary 
      investigations showed less hearing impairment. Averaging all frequencies the 
      improvement of hearing ability was around 1 dB. Above 1 kHz the average hearing 
      of the right ear was up to 7 dB better than that of the left ear. Age-induced 
      hearing loss was 3 to 8 dB lower than predicted by ISO standards over the entire 
      frequency range. The side of the ear (right/left) and the frequency (3, 4, and 
      6 kHz) were significant (p < 0.05) in hearing loss, whereas the influence of the 
      instrument and the acoustic traumata were not. CONCLUSION: Despite the high noise 
      levels, the average hearing ability of the 36 military musicians during the 
      investigation period only slightly deteriorated in the noise-sensitive 
      frequencies (3, 5 and 6 kHz). Music may be less harmful than industrial noise, or 
      the long-term auditory training of the musicians leads to a delayed presbycusis.

TI  - Auditory brain stem response to complex sounds: a tutorial.
PG  - 302-24
LID - 10.1097/AUD.0b013e3181cdb272 [doi]
AB  - This tutorial provides a comprehensive overview of the methodological approach to 
      collecting and analyzing auditory brain stem responses to complex sounds (cABRs). 
      cABRs provide a window into how behaviorally relevant sounds such as speech and 
      music are processed in the brain. Because temporal and spectral characteristics 
      of sounds are preserved in this subcortical response, cABRs can be used to assess 
      specific impairments and enhancements in auditory processing. Notably, 
      subcortical auditory function is neither passive nor hardwired but dynamically 
      interacts with higher-level cognitive processes to refine how sounds are 
      transcribed into neural code. This experience-dependent plasticity, which can 
      occur on a number of time scales (e.g., life-long experience with speech or 
      music, short-term auditory training, on-line auditory processing), helps shape 
      sensory perception. Thus, by being an objective and noninvasive means for 
      examining cognitive function and experience-dependent processes in sensory 
      activity, cABRs have considerable utility in the study of populations where 
      auditory function is of interest (e.g., auditory experts such as musicians, and 
      persons with hearing loss, auditory processing, and language disorders). This 
      tutorial is intended for clinicians and researchers seeking to integrate cABRs 
      into their clinical or research programs.

TI  - Transient evoked otoacoustic emissions in rock musicians.
PG  - 685-691
LID - 10.1080/14992027.2017.1321788 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our focus in this study was the assessment of transient evoked 
      otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs) in a large group of rock musicians. A further 
      objective was to analyse tinnitus among rock musicians as related to TEOAEs. 
      DESIGN: The study was a cross-sectional survey of rock musicians selected at 
      random. A control group was included at random for comparison. STUDY SAMPLE: We 
      recruited 111 musicians and a control group of 40 non-musicians. Testing was 
      conducted by using clinical examination, pure tone audiometry, TEOAEs and a 
      questionnaire. RESULTS: TEOAE SNR in the half-octave frequency band centred on 
      4 kHz was significantly lower bilaterally in musicians than controls. This effect 
      was strongly predicted by age and pure-tone hearing threshold levels in the 
      3-6 kHz range. Bilateral hearing thresholds were significantly higher at 6 kHz in 
      musicians. Twenty percent of the musicians had permanent tinnitus. There was no 
      association between the TEOAE parameters and permanent tinnitus. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      results suggest an incipient hearing loss at 6 kHz in rock musicians. Loss of 
      TEOAE SNR in the 4 kHz half-octave frequency band was observed, but it was 
      related to higher mean 3-6 kHz hearing thresholds and age. A large proportion of 
      rock musicians have permanent tinnitus.

TI  - Assessment of occupational personal sound exposures for music instructors.
PG  - 139-148
LID - 10.1080/15459624.2020.1867729 [doi]
AB  - Daily activities performed by music instructors generate high sound levels that 
      could potentially lead to overexposure. Adverse outcomes associated with 
      high-exposure to sound, such as hearing loss and tinnitus, can be especially 
      devastating to music instructors as hearing is essential to both job performance 
      and career reward. The primary objective of this study was to compare sound 
      exposures of music instructors to recommended exposure limits. Secondary 
      objectives were to identify high-exposure activities and to evaluate potential 
      similar exposure groups by examining between- and within-worker exposure 
      variability. Personal sound exposure measurements from music instructors were 
      collected using dosimeters during full workdays for up to 4 weeks over multiple 
      semesters at a university's school of music. Study participants completed an 
      activity log to record work-related activities throughout each day of sampling. 
      Dosimeters logged 1-sec sound equivalent levels in A-weighted decibels. These 
      data were used to calculate 8-hr time-weighted averages, daily dose, and 
      activity-specific contributions to that dose to determine if daily exposures 
      exceeded the recommended limit of 85 dBA and to identify high-exposure activities 
      that could be targeted for future intervention. Seventeen participants were 
      sampled for a total of 200 days. Approximately one-third of daily exposures 
      exceeded recommended limits. The groups with the highest exposures were brass and 
      conducting instructors. Conductors experienced the highest between-day 
      variability in daily exposures. Activities that contributed the most to daily 
      dose included group rehearsals, personal practice sessions, and performances, 
      while classes and administrative work did not substantially contribute to daily 
      dose. Daily exposures were highly variable, ranging from 60-95 dBA (mean = 81 
      dBA, sd = 8 dBA), and were influenced by instructional area and musical activity. 
      Future exposure assessments for music instructors should include sampling for 
      multiple days, and those above-recommended limits should be placed into hearing 
      conservation programs.

TI  - Hearing Protection Success: Musicians Have a Favorable Response to Hearing 
      Protection and Listeners Are Unable to Identify Music Produced by Musicians 
      Wearing Hearing Protection.
PG  - 763-770
LID - 10.1055/s-0040-1719128 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Musicians are known to be at risk for developing hearing sensitivity 
      and hearing-related problems given their occupational exposure to high-level 
      sound. Among options for hearing conservation, earplugs are an effective and 
      inexpensive choice. Adoption rates for musicians' earplugs remains consistently 
      low, however, given concerns about the impact of hearing protection on their own 
      performance as well as concerns that the resultant music will be a negative 
      experience for listeners. In fact, few studies have (1) examined musicians' 
      attitudes about using hearing protection while performing themselves and (2) 
      determined whether music played by musicians wearing hearing protection sounds 
      different to listeners. PURPOSE: The purposes of this study were (1) to evaluate 
      how wearing musicians' earplugs affected musicians' perception of their 
      performance while they were playing, and (2) to examine whether listeners can 
      distinguish a difference between music recorded by musicians playing with and 
      without earplugs. RESEARCH DESIGN: Experiment 1: student musicians were recorded 
      playing under two conditions (with and without wearing earplugs) and then were 
      surveyed about their experience. Experiment 2: musically experienced and naïve 
      listeners were presented with musical samples played by musicians with and 
      without earplugs in an ABX format. Listeners responded by indicating whether the 
      third stimulus (X) was conditionally identical to the first (A) or second 
      stimulus (B). RESULTS: Experiment 1: while performing, musicians always preferred 
      the no earplugs condition. The majority, however, rated the overall experience of 
      playing with earplugs as generally positive. Experiment 2: listeners were unable 
      to hear a difference between the two recordings. DISCUSSION: In this experiment, 
      musicians rated their experience playing without hearing protection more 
      favorably than their experience playing with hearing protection, but most 
      musicians rated their experience with hearing protection as generally positive. 
      The inability of listeners to distinguish a difference in music played with and 
      without hearing protection suggests that the listening experience may not be 
      adversely impacted by hearing protection worn by the performers. CONCLUSION: 
      Earplugs are an inexpensive, noninvasive strategy for hearing conservation for 
      musicians, and this study indicates that barriers to wearing hearing protection 
      might be less problematic than previously reported.

AB  - The musician Ludwig van Beethoven suffered from hearing impairment and abdominal 
      pain beginning in his mid-twenties. Lead intoxication can cause both of neural 
      symptoms and digestive disorders. Lead was often present in poor-quality wines at 
      that period, and thus Beethoven could have ingested a large amount of lead 
      through daily wine consumption. His auditory processing disorder was merely a 
      deficit in the lower level bottom-up processing of musical sounds or voice 
      inputs, and probably did not affect higher level top-down processing, such as the 
      representation of auditory imagery and composition.

PG  - 173-9
AB  - Performance-related disorders in musicians are most often caused by multiple risk 
      factors. They are based on the chronic complex, rapid and forceful work that 
      requires highest precision, as well as on poor ergonomic conditions and 
      psychological strain. Predominantly, the musculo-skeletal system of the upper 
      extremity and the spine is affected by acute or chronic pain syndromes and 
      neurological disorders. Stage fright and psychological tension frequently 
      generate somatoform disorders and may contribute to the chronification of 
      physical disabilities in musicians. Depending on the individual characteristics, 
      the actual professional activity and the specific instrument, the 
      performance-related risk factors and disorders differ widely. Early and regular 
      prevention clearly contributes to a reduction of medical problems in musicians.

TI  - Hearing impairment in orchestral musicians.
PG  - 243-9
AB  - Symphony orchestra musicians from The Royal Danish Theatre (15 females and 80 
      males) aged 22 to 64 years were audiologically examined to elucidate the presence 
      and the frequency of noise-induced hearing loss among classical musicians. 
      Compared to a reference material (ISO 7029) the median hearing thresholds of the 
      musicians were increased for all age groups. When using hearing sensitivity in 
      one or both ears less than 20 dB HL as a criterion for normality, it was found 
      the 58% of the musicians had a hearing impairment. 50% of the males and 13% of 
      the females showed a typical audiogram with a notched curve at higher frequencies 
      normally attributed to occupational noise exposure. Furthermore, a significantly 
      poorer hearing on the left ear was found at higher frequencies among the 
      violinists. It is concluded that symphonic musicians suffer from hearing 
      impairment and that the impairment might be ascribed to symphonic music.

AB  - The mammalian cochlea functions as a filter bank that performs a spectral, 
      Fourier-like decomposition on the acoustic signal. While tuning can be 
      compromised (e.g., broadened with hearing impairment), whether or not human 
      cochlear frequency resolution can be sharpened through experiential factors 
      (e.g., training or learning) has not yet been established. Previous studies have 
      demonstrated sharper psychophysical tuning curves in trained musicians compared 
      to nonmusicians, implying superior peripheral tuning. However, these findings are 
      based on perceptual masking paradigms, and reflect engagement of the entire 
      auditory system rather than cochlear tuning, per se. Here, by directly mapping 
      physiological tuning curves from stimulus frequency otoacoustic emissions 
      (SFOAEs)-cochlear emitted sounds-we show that estimates of human cochlear tuning 
      in a high-frequency cochlear region (4 kHz) is further sharpened (by a factor of 
      1.5×) in musicians and improves with the number of years of their auditory 
      training. These findings were corroborated by measurements of psychophysical 
      tuning curves (PTCs) derived via simultaneous masking, which similarly showed 
      sharper tuning in musicians. Comparisons between SFOAE and PTCs revealed closer 
      correspondence between physiological and behavioral curves in musicians, 
      indicating that tuning is also more consistent between different levels of 
      auditory processing in trained ears. Our findings demonstrate an 
      experience-dependent enhancement in the resolving power of the cochlear sensory 
      epithelium and the spectral resolution of human hearing and provide a peripheral 
      account for the auditory perceptual benefits observed in musicians. Both local 
      and feedback (e.g., medial olivocochlear efferent) mechanisms are discussed as 
      potential mechanisms for experience-dependent tuning.

AB  - The auditory channel is one of the most affected by the activity of musicians. 
      The aim of this study was to verify the efficiency of the Monitor of Hearing In 
      Ear regarding prevention of the hearing loss in the activity realized by 
      musicians. This study justifies by the need to verify a possible method of 
      protection for these professionals. It was analyzed a group of 10 musicians of a 
      band of dance of Santa Catarina. The methods of research were questionnaires, 
      audiometry and analysis of the technical specifications of Monitors of Hearing In 
      Ear. The population investigated are aged between 18-56, and time in the 
      profession between 37 and 0,4 years. The exhibition is of, roughly, 12 hours a 
      week during the presentations, 4,5 hours a week rehearsing in group and from 1 to 
      8 weekly hours of isolated rehearsal. It was observed that 40% of the population 
      presented normal hearing thresholds for left and right ear, the sensorineural 
      hearing loss in the left ear was ascertained in 40% and 20% presented 
      sensorineural hearing loss in both ears. The advantage of the Monitor of Hearing 
      In Ear is that there is the blocking of the undesirable sounds, making possible a 
      greater audible reduction, generally between 25 and 40 dB, showing possibility to 
      be considered a half of protection for professional musicians.

TI  - Does classical music damage the hearing of musicians? A review of the literature.
PG  - 130-6
AB  - Hearing losses resulting from noise exposure have been described for over 150 
      years. Studies looking at the effect music might have on hearing began more 
      recently in the 1960s. Such work has established a firm association between live 
      rock and roll music and hearing loss in musicians. However, the evidence that 
      classical music may damage the hearing of musicians remains conflicting. This 
      paper reviews the published literature.

      Survey.
PG  - 50-57
LID - 10.5935/0946-5448.20170010 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Rock musicians are known to have an increased prevalence of hearing 
      loss and tinnitus. The aims of the present study were to examine the distribution 
      of anxiety and depression symptoms among rock musicians with or without tinnitus 
      and how these mental health indicators and internal locus of control influenced 
      upon their tinnitus symptom concerns and the degree to which the tinnitus 
      affected their lives. DESIGN: The study was a questionnairebased cross-sectional 
      survey of subjects selected from a cohort of rock musicians. We recruited 111 
      active musicians from the Oslo region, and a control group of 40 non-musicians 
      from the student population at the University of Tromso. RESULTS: Among the rock 
      musicians 19.8% reported permanent tinnitus vs. 0% among the controls. Musicians 
      more often reported anxiety symptoms than controls (35.1% vs. 17.5%), however 
      this prevalence was not different in musicians with and without tinnitus. 
      Tinnitus-affected musicians reported depressive symptoms, significantly more than 
      controls (13.6% vs. 5%). Rock musicians consumed more alcohol than controls, but 
      alcohol consumption was unrelated to severity of tinnitus. Drug abuse was not 
      more prevalent in rock musicians than in controls. Duration of tinnitus, internal 
      locus of control, sleep disturbance and anxiety were significant predictors of 
      how affected and how concerned musicians were about their tinnitus. CONCLUSION: 
      Rock musicians are at risk for the development of chronic tinnitus, and they have 
      an increased prevalence of anxiety. There is an association between chronic 
      tinnitus and depressive symptoms in rock musicians, but our results are 
      ambiguous. Although rock musicians have a chronic exposure to noise, 
      noise-induced hearing loss is not the sole causative agent for the development of 
      tinnitus.

TI  - Description and evaluation of a hearing conservation program in use in a 
      professional symphony orchestra.
PG  - 265-76
LID - 10.1093/annhyg/meu092 [doi]
AB  - Professional orchestral musicians risk permanent hearing loss while playing their 
      instruments. Protecting the hearing of these musicians in the workplace is 
      critical to their ongoing ability to play their instruments, but typical 
      workplace hearing conservation measures can have very damaging effects on the 
      product (music) and the musicians' abilities to hear one another sufficiently. To 
      enable effective intervention, orchestras as employers must encourage engagement 
      with hearing protection programs and implement controls while preserving the 
      integrity of the music. To achieve this, typical approaches used in other 
      industries must be redesigned to suit this unique workplace. In response to these 
      challenges, the Queensland Symphony Orchestra (Brisbane, Australia) introduced a 
      comprehensive hearing conservation strategy in 2005 based upon best practice at 
      the time. This strategy-which has been regularly refined-continues to be 
      implemented on a daily basis. This investigation aimed to assess the successes, 
      difficulties, and practical viability of the program. To achieve this a process 
      evaluation was carried out, incorporating archival analyses, player and 
      management focus groups, and an interview with the program's administrator. 
      Results show the program has successfully become integrated into the orchestra's 
      and the musicians' daily operations and significantly contributes to managing the 
      risk of hearing loss in this population. While there is room for improvement in 
      the orchestra's approach-particularly regarding usable personal protective 
      devices and improved education and training, results are encouraging. This study 
      provides a basis for those wishing to implement or evaluate similar paradigms.

AB  - Individuals with sensorineural hearing loss have difficulty understanding speech, 
      especially in background noise. This deficit remains even when audibility is 
      restored through amplification, suggesting that mechanisms beyond a reduction in 
      peripheral sensitivity contribute to the perceptual difficulties associated with 
      hearing loss. Given that normal-hearing musicians have enhanced auditory 
      perceptual skills, including speech-in-noise perception, coupled with heightened 
      subcortical responses to speech, we aimed to determine whether similar advantages 
      could be observed in middle-aged adults with hearing loss. Results indicate that 
      musicians with hearing loss, despite self-perceptions of average performance for 
      understanding speech in noise, have a greater ability to hear in noise relative 
      to nonmusicians. This is accompanied by more robust subcortical encoding of sound 
      (e.g., stimulus-to-response correlations and response consistency) as well as 
      more resilient neural responses to speech in the presence of background noise 
      (e.g., neural timing). Musicians with hearing loss also demonstrate unique neural 
      signatures of spectral encoding relative to nonmusicians: enhanced neural 
      encoding of the speech-sound's fundamental frequency but not of its upper 
      harmonics. This stands in contrast to previous outcomes in normal-hearing 
      musicians, who have enhanced encoding of the harmonics but not the fundamental 
      frequency. Taken together, our data suggest that although hearing loss modifies a 
      musician's spectral encoding of speech, the musician advantage for perceiving 
      speech in noise persists in a hearing-impaired population by adaptively 
      strengthening underlying neural mechanisms for speech-in-noise perception.

TI  - [The professional ear user-implications for the prevention, diagnosis, and 
      treatment of ear diseases].
PG  - 891-902
LID - 10.1007/s00106-022-01235-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Perfect hearing is crucial to the practice of various professions, 
      such as instrument makers, musicians, sound engineers, and other professions not 
      related to music, such as sonar technicians. For people of these occupational 
      groups, we propose the term "professional ear user" (PEU) in analogy to 
      "professional voice user". PEUs have special requirements for their hearing 
      health, as they have well-known above-average auditory perceptual abilities on 
      which they are professionally dependent. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this narrative 
      review is to summarize selected aspects of the prevention, diagnosis, and 
      treatment of ear disorders in PEUs. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Prevention of hearing 
      disorders and other ear diseases includes protection from excessive sound levels, 
      avoidance of ototoxins and nicotine, and a safe manner of cleaning the outer 
      auditory canal. Diagnosing hearing disorders in PEUs can be challenging, since 
      subclinical but relevant changes in hearing cannot be reliably objectified by 
      conventional audiometric methods. Moreover, the fact that a PEU is affected by an 
      ear disease may influence treatment decisions. Further, physicians must be 
      vigilant for non-organic ear diseases in PEUs. Lastly, measures to promote 
      comprehensive ear health in PEUs as part of an educational program and to 
      maintain ear health by means of a specialized otolaryngology service are 
      discussed. In contrast to existing concepts, we lay the attention on the entirety 
      of occupational groups that are specifically dependent on their ear health in 
      a professional setting. In this context, we suggest avoiding a sole focus on 
      hearing disorders and their prevention, but rather encourage the maintenance of a 
      comprehensive ear health.

TI  - Evaluation of hearing protection device effectiveness for musicians.
PG  - 238-244
LID - 10.1080/14992027.2022.2035831 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate musicians' personal attenuation and perceptions of three 
      types of hearing protection devices (HPDs): formable foam earplugs and both 
      non-custom and custom versions of uniform attenuation earplugs (UAEs) marketed to 
      musicians. DESIGN: A mixed-methods approach was used to evaluate the HPDs. 
      Audiometric testing obtained hearing levels at baseline and with each HPD across 
      frequencies (125-8000 Hz) to determine personal attenuation ratings and 
      uniformity of attenuation. Participants completed surveys over six months 
      regarding how often they used the HPDs and their perceptions about wearing them. 
      STUDY SAMPLE: Twenty-four musicians were recruited to participate. RESULTS: 
      Substantial variability was observed in the attenuation achieved among 
      participants for each HPD type, but custom UAEs provided the most consistent 
      attenuation across frequencies. Participants' HPD preferences were influenced by 
      multiple factors including personal instrument and specific activity. Custom UAEs 
      were most frequently used but usage rates continually decreased over the 6-month 
      period. CONCLUSIONS: Fit-testing is important to determine fit and sizing. 
      Combining information on the effectiveness of HPDs with musicians' opinions about 
      wearing them can inform recommendations for which types may be the most effective 
      and feasible options for reducing sound exposures.

TI  - Levels of Music Played by Caucasian and Filipino Musicians with and without 
      Conventional and Musicians' Earplugs.
PG  - 78-88
LID - 10.3766/jaaa.17097 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Some musicians may play the music louder while using earplugs thus 
      reducing the effectiveness of the hearing protection offered by earplugs. In 
      addition, the dynamic range (DR) of the music may be altered because of the use 
      of earplugs with negative impact on perceived quality of music. There are some 
      cultural differences in attitudes toward loudness, which may lead to differences 
      in the loudness of music played by musicians from different cultures. PURPOSE: To 
      investigate the effect of the use of two different types of earplugs on the 
      loudness and DR of music played by musicians of Caucasian and Filipino origins. 
      RESEARCH DESIGN: Quasi-experimental repeated measures design. STUDY SAMPLE: 
      Thirty six musicians with normal hearing within the age range of 18-49 yr. 
      Fifteen were of Caucasian (eight men and 7 women) origin and 21 were of the 
      Filipino (nine men and 12 women) origin. INTERVENTION: All participants received 
      a brief educational session, which included information on music-induced hearing 
      loss, the benefit of using earplugs, and the correct procedures for inserting and 
      removing earplugs. They played music in five different conditions (three min 
      each): Trial 1 of conventional and musicians' earplugs in random order, no 
      earplug, and trial 2 of conventional and musicians' earplugs in random order. 
      DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Maximum, minimum, average (average sound level 
      measured over the measurement period; LAVG), and peak levels were recorded using 
      a dosimeter while playing music in each of the five conditions. The DR was 
      derived by subtracting the minimum values from the maximum values. A different 
      measure of the dynamic range 2 (DR2) was derived by subtracting the LAVG value 
      from the peak value. Mixed analyses of variance (ANOVA) (Cultural origin and 
      Gender as nonrepeated variables) was performed on LAVG, DR, and DR2. RESULTS: 
      Based on the LAVG levels yielded by them, 42-61% of the musicians may be at risk 
      for hearing loss. The mixed ANOVA revealed some main effects of culture and some 
      significant interactions involving cultural origin, the plug conditions, type of 
      earplugs, and trial number. CONCLUSIONS: Use of earplugs may vary the overall 
      loudness of music, the DR, or the DR2 in some musicians depending on the type of 
      earplugs and cultural origin, and the effect may change with practice.

TI  - [Acute hearing loss and tinnitus caused by amplified recreational music].
PG  - 614-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hearing loss resulting from exposure to permanent or repeated 
      amplified music in professional musicians and music consumers is described in 
      literature. The risk of hearing loss does not exist only after prolonged exposure 
      to music. Short-term exposure to very high sound levels, for example in concerts, 
      can also cause hearing loss and tinnitus. PATIENTS: The retrospective study 
      includes 24 patients who required rheologic therapy between 1994 and 1997 due to 
      a music related acoustic trauma. The type, intensity, and length of music 
      exposure as well as the distance and the position to the source of noise were 
      examined. The type of hearing damage and its development during rheological 
      treatment was studied by pure-tone audiometry. RESULTS: In the majority of 
      examined patients (67%) the hearing loss developed on the basis of one-time 
      exposure at a rock concert or pop concert, followed by hearing loss from 
      attending discotheques (17%) or parties (12%), and music exposure from personal 
      cassette players (4%). The majority of patients showed a maximum hearing loss of 
      40-60 dB (A) in a frequency between 3 kHz and 4 kHz. Pure-tone audiometry in 58% 
      of the patients exhibited a unilateral threshold in a frequency between 3 kHz and 
      4 kHz combined with ipsilateral tinnitus of the same frequency. Twenty-one 
      percent of the patients showed a symmetric bilateral threshold and tinnitus 
      between 3 kHz and 4 kHz. In 8% there was a unilateral tinnitus, and in 13% a 
      bilateral tinnitus without any hearing loss. All patients improved their hearing 
      loss during rheologic treatment. Improvement in the tinnitus was only achieved in 
      33% of the examined cases. CONCLUSION: The risk of permanent hearing loss 
      resulting from short-term exposure to amplified music is low compared to the risk 
      of continuous tinnitus. Given the lack of acceptance of personal ear protectors, 
      the risk of acute hearing damage due to amplified music could be reduced by 
      avoiding the immediate proximity to the speakers.

TI  - [The fetus and noise].
PG  - 119-29
AB  - From 23 weeks of gestation some and from 28 weeks all healthy fetuses are capable 
      of reacting to sound stimulation. The intrauterine acoustic environment is 
      dominated by maternal sounds--heartbeat, breathing, the mother's voice, 
      borborygmi and sounds caused by body movements. Background noise is never below 
      28 dB and can rise to 84 dB when the mother is singing. Noises that are meant to 
      reach the fetus must be louder than the background noise and must be of low 
      frequency as high frequency sounds are damped by maternal tissue. Vibroacoustic 
      stimulation tests (VAST) have become popular in pregnancy surveillance over the 
      last 20 years, mostly using an artificial larynx. Advantages and problems of the 
      various VAST protocols in fetal monitoring are discussed in the light of animal 
      experiments and clinical studies. Health legislation laws in most countries 
      forbid pregnant women to work in surroundings with a high noise level (80 dB 
      continuous noise and/or rapid impulse noise changes of 40 dB). Whereas 
      regulations for pregnant women are easy to enforce in industry, pregnant women 
      employed in discos or performing as musicians spend most of their working day 
      exposed to noise impact higher than the recommended limit.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Tinnitus is one of the most reported auditory symptoms among 
      musicians and can negatively influence their ability to work, sometimes even more 
      severely than hearing loss. OBJECTIVES: To analyze the occurrence of tinnitus and 
      other auditory symptoms in musicians who play different instruments. METHODS: One 
      hundred musicians participated by answering a questionnaire on instrument played, 
      practice time with the instrument, occurrence of tinnitus, hearing difficulties, 
      and intolerance to loud sounds. The symptoms were analyzed in relation to gender, 
      musical instrument, and time of experience using statistical tests such as the 
      Chi-squared test and Difference in Proportions test at a significance level of 
      0.05 as well as finding the Prevalence Ratio. RESULTS: Tinnitus was the most 
      frequent symptom among musicians, especially among those who play amplified 
      instruments. There was an association between tinnitus and hearing difficulty, 
      and between instrument experience time and intolerance to loud sounds. The 
      proportion of musicians with occasional tinnitus was high among those with less 
      than 15 years of musical practice, and 4.53 times more prevalent in those with 
      more than 15 years of experience. CONCLUSION: The presence of auditory symptoms, 
      especially tinnitus, among musicians reinforces the need for implementation of 
      hearing conservation programs for this profession.

TI  - Prevalence of and Risk Factors for Tinnitus and Tinnitus-Related Handicap in a 
      College-Aged Population.
PG  - 517-526
LID - 10.1097/AUD.0000000000000503 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Tinnitus is a common otological condition that affects almost 10% of 
      US adults. Research suggests that college students are vulnerable to tinnitus and 
      hearing loss as they are exposed to traumatic levels of noise on a regular basis. 
      Tinnitus and its influence in daily living continue to be underappreciated in the 
      college-aged population. Therefore, the objective for the present study was to 
      analyze prevalence and associated risk factors of tinnitus and tinnitus-related 
      handicap in a sample of college-aged students. DESIGN: A survey was administered 
      to 678 students aged 18-30 years in a cross-section of randomly selected 
      university classes. The survey was adopted from the National Health and Nutrition 
      Examination Survey (2010). It inquired about demographic details, medical and 
      audiological history, routine noise exposure, smoking, sound level tolerance, 
      tinnitus, and tinnitus-related handicap in daily living. Tinnitus-related 
      handicap was assessed by the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI). Participants were 
      divided into four groups: chronic tinnitus (bothersome tinnitus for >1 year), 
      acute tinnitus (bothersome tinnitus for ≤1 year), subacute tinnitus (at least one 
      experience of tinnitus in a lifetime), and no tinnitus (no experience of tinnitus 
      in a lifetime). RESULTS: The prevalence of chronic, acute, subacute, and no 
      tinnitus was 8.4%, 13.0%, 37.9%, and 40.7% respectively. Almost 9% of subjects 
      with any form of tinnitus reported more than a slight tinnitus-related handicap 
      (i.e., THI score ≥18). A multinomial regression analysis revealed that 
      individuals with high noise exposure, high sound level tolerance score, recurring 
      ear infections, and self-reported hearing loss had high odds of chronic tinnitus. 
      Females showed higher prevalence of acute tinnitus than males. Individuals with 
      European American ethnicity and smoking history showed high odds of reporting 
      subacute tinnitus. Almost 10% of the subjects reported that they were music 
      students. The prevalence of chronic, acute, and subacute tinnitus was 11.3%, 
      22.5%, and 32.4%, respectively, for musicians, which was significantly higher 
      than that for nonmusicians. Music exposure, firearm noise exposure, and 
      occupational noise exposure were significantly correlated with tinnitus. Temporal 
      characteristics of tinnitus, self-reported tinnitus loudness, and sound level 
      tolerance were identified as major predictors for the overall THI score. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Despite the reluctance to complain about tinnitus, a substantial 
      portion of college-aged individuals reported tinnitus experience and its adverse 
      influence in daily living. It was concluded that environmental and health-related 
      factors can trigger tinnitus perception, while self-reported psychoacoustic 
      descriptors of tinnitus may explain perceived tinnitus-related handicap in daily 
      living by college-aged individuals. Future research is required to explore 
      effects of tinnitus on educational achievements, social interaction, and 
      vocational aspects of college students.

TI  - Association Analysis of Candidate Gene Polymorphisms and Audiometric Measures of 
      Noise-Induced Hearing Loss in Young Musicians.
PG  - e538-e547
LID - 10.1097/MAO.0000000000002615 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to investigate the association between candidate 
      genetic variants and audiometric measures of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) in 
      young musicians. METHODS: The study analyzed a database by Phillips et al. 
      (Feasibility of a bilateral 4000-6000 Hz notch as a phenotype for genetic 
      association analysis. Int J Audiol 2015;54:645-52.) which included behavioral 
      hearing thresholds, distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE), 
      tympanometric, and genetic data of 166 participants meeting the inclusion 
      criteria. Nineteen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 13 cochlear genes 
      previously associated with NIHL in factory workers were included in the present 
      investigation. The average hearing threshold at 3000 and 4000 Hz (AHT) and 
      average DPOAE signal to noise ratio (DPOAE SNR) in both ears were calculated. 
      RESULTS: The regression analyses showed that two SNPs- one in KCNE1 (rs2070358) 
      and the other in CAT (rs12273124) revealed a statistically significant 
      relationship with DPOAE SNR in both ears. Two SNPs in MYH14 and one in GJB4 
      revealed a significant association with DPOAE SNR in the left ear. Two SNPs in 
      HSP70, one in CDH23 and one in KCNJ10 showed significant association with DPOAE 
      SNR in the right ear. None of the included SNPs showed association with AHT in 
      both ears. CONCLUSIONS: A genetic variant in KCNE1 was associated with the 
      strength of the cochlear amplifier as assessed by DPOAE SNR. Musicians carrying 
      causal genetic variants to NIHL might exhibit changes in their auditory functions 
      early in the lifespan even when most subjects had their hearing thresholds within 
      normal limits. These participants are likely to show the clinical manifestation 
      of NIHL in the future if no preventive measures are applied.

PG  - 140-5
LID - 10.1177/1084713812471586 [doi]
AB  - Music can have sound levels that are in excess of the capability of most modern 
      digital hearing aids to transduce sound without significant distortion. One 
      innovation is to use a hearing aid microphone that is less sensitive to some of 
      the lower frequency intense components of music, thereby providing the 
      analog-to-digital (A/D) converter with an input that is within its optimal 
      operating region. The "missing" low-frequency information can still enter through 
      an unoccluded earmold as unamplified sound and be part of the entire music 
      listening experience. Technical issues with this alternative microphone 
      configuration include an increase in the internal noise floor of the hearing aid, 
      but with judicious use of expansion, the noise floor can significantly be 
      reduced. Other issues relate to fittings where significant low-frequency 
      amplification is also required, but this type of fitting can be optimized in the 
      fitting software by adding amplification after the A/D bottle neck.

TI  - Hearing loss in steelband musicians.
PG  - 461-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the difference in hearing between a group of steelband 
      musicians (pannists) and a control group. DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND SUBJECTS: We 
      conducted a controlled cross-sectional pilot study consisting of 29 steelpan 
      players and 30 control subjects from a steelpan orchestra (steelband) in the 
      Otolaryngology Department of the Eric Williams Medical Sciences Complex. RESULTS: 
      Significantly more steelpan players had a hearing loss than the control subjects 
      at 3000 Hz, 4000 Hz, and 6000 Hz ( P < 0.01). chi 2 testing for trend 
      demonstrated that the longer a steelpan player played his instrument the greater 
      the hearing loss. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that pannists suffer 
      permanent auditory damage from high-intensity sound levels and that preventative 
      measures are required to prevent this hearing loss, particularly in younger 
      players.

AB  - The effects of chronic exposure to high sound pressure levels (SPLs) are widely 
      studied in the industry environment. However, the way that SPLs affect music 
      students has not been thoroughly examined. In this paper, we study the SPL 
      exposure of batucada students and we propose an assisted protection headphone as 
      a part of e-health system. We measured the SPL reached during a regular 
      percussion class. Pure-tone audiometries were performed to a set of percussion 
      students. The gathered data were statistically analyzed. The assisted protection 
      headphones and their operation are detailed and tested during a regular class. 
      Our results show that 35% of the musicians present with a noise-induced hearing 
      loss, considered as two frequencies with hearing loss of 25 dB or more or one 
      frequency with a hearing loss of 30 dB or more. Our data also shows that those 
      students that do not use any protection have a greater hearing loss. However, the 
      students that use protection headphones are also suffering hearing loss. There 
      might be a problem in the way that musicians are using the protection headphones. 
      Our assisted protection headphones as a part of e-health measures can diminish 
      the negative effects of percussion instruments for musicians.

TI  - Nature of orchestral noise.
PG  - 926-39
LID - 10.1121/1.2940589 [doi]
AB  - Professional orchestral musicians are at risk of exposure to excessive noise when 
      at work. This is an industry-wide problem that threatens not only the hearing of 
      orchestral musicians but also the way orchestras operate. The research described 
      in this paper recorded noise levels within a professional orchestra over three 
      years in order to provide greater insight to the orchestral noise environment; to 
      guide future research into orchestral noise management and hearing conservation 
      strategies; and to provide a basis for the future education of musicians and 
      their managers. Every rehearsal, performance, and recording from May 2004 to May 
      2007 was monitored, with the woodwind, brass, and percussion sections monitored 
      in greatest detail. The study recorded dBALEQ and dBC peak data, which are 
      presented in graphical form with accompanying summarized data tables. The 
      findings indicate that the principal trumpet, first and third horns, and 
      principal trombone are at greatest risk of exposure to excessive sustained noise 
      levels and that the percussion and timpani are at greatest risk of exposure to 
      excessive peak noise levels. However, the findings also strongly support the 
      notion that the true nature of orchestral noise is a great deal more complex than 
      this simple statement would imply.

TI  - Audiological and noise exposure findings among members of a Brazilian folklore 
      music group.
PG  - 235-241
LID - 10.3233/WOR-203370 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Musicians and dancers can be considered an at-risk population for 
      developing noise-induced hearing loss. OBJECTIVES: To determine the audiological 
      profile of members of a folklore-related music group and quantify noise exposure 
      at their rehearsal venue. METHODS: This was a quantitative and descriptive study. 
      The musicians and dancers were evaluated in two stages: an interview about their 
      working life, followed by high frequency tonal audiometry. The sound pressure 
      level in the group's rehearsal venue was measured using a BEK 2270 Noise 
      Analyzer. RESULTS: A total of 7.2% of the subjects had noise-induced hearing loss 
      (NIHL) and 39% of the audiometric tests were notch type. During the interview 
      31.7% of the subjects mentioned discomfort from loud noise, although none of them 
      used ear protection. The environmental assessment showed inadequate humidity and 
      oscillating temperature. Twenty sound pressure level measurements were performed 
      for Leq (equivalent sound pressure levels) and the results ranged from 88 dB (A) 
      to 99 dB (A) with a mean of 97.05. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to high levels of sound 
      pressure has led to NIHL in some members of the group. Some of those with normal 
      hearing also presented a notch configuration characteristic of NIHL. Tinnitus, 
      indicating that a change in hearing has occurred, was the most frequent auditory 
      symptom.

TI  - Athletes and the arts--the role of sports medicine in the performing arts.
PG  - 397-403
LID - 10.1249/JSR.0000000000000009 [doi]
AB  - Performing artists are athletes. Like athletes, performing artists practice 
      and/or perform most days with little off season, play through pain, "compete" in 
      challenging environments, and risk career-threatening injury. Athletes and the 
      Arts is a multiorganizational initiative linking the sport athlete and 
      musician/performing artist communities. Performing artists of all ages and genre 
      are an underserved population related to medical coverage, care, injury 
      prevention, performance enhancement, and wellness. Sports medicine professionals 
      are a valuable resource for filling this gap by applying existing knowledge of 
      treating sport athletes (nutrition, injury prevention) while gaining a better 
      understanding of performers' unique needs (hearing loss, focal dystonia) and 
      environment. These applications can occur in the clinical setting and through 
      developing organizational policies. By better understanding the needs of the 
      performing arts population and applying existing concepts and knowledge, sports 
      medicine professionals can expand their impact to a new patient base that 
      desperately needs support.

TI  - [Effects of noise on inner ear].
PG  - 979-84
AB  - The effects of noise on health depend both on individual factors and 
      characteristics of sound exposure. In case of acoustic trauma, reversible or 
      irreversible lesions of inner ear components are possible. Most often there is 
      immediately an acute tinnitus and hearing loss. Audiometric tests demonstrate 
      hearing loss on the high frequency, generally focused on 4 kHz. Immediate 
      treatment is recommended even there is no currently indicator of the ability to 
      restore hearing. New perspectives on treatment are directed to local treatment 
      and/or using new procedure as antioxidative treatment. Occupational and leisure 
      are the two conditions in which chronic exposure to noise is found. Detection and 
      prevention of noise-induced hearing loss is easier in case of industrial workers 
      than in case of noise exposition for musicians and other sounds and stage 
      technicians or concert managers, and of course non-professional with exposure to 
      amplified music.

TI  - Symphony orchestra musicians' use of hearing protection and attenuation of 
      custom-made hearing protectors as measured with two different real-ear 
      attenuation at threshold methods.
PG  - 176-88
LID - 10.4103/1463-1741.77210 [doi]
AB  - Despite a high level of sound exposure and a fairly large selection of earplugs 
      available, musicians have often been reported to use personal hearing protectors 
      only seldom. For better hearing conservation, it is important to identify and 
      eliminate the causes for the low motivation to use hearing protection. We 
      explored the usage rate of custom-molded musician's earplugs (ER-15) among 15 
      symphony orchestra musicians with a questionnaire, and measured the attenuation 
      properties of their earplugs with a Real-Ear Attenuation at Threshold (REAT) 
      procedure in a sound field. Earplug use was found to be low, and the musicians 
      reported that earplugs hampered listening to their own and their colleagues' 
      playing; earplugs affected either timbre or dynamics, or both. Additionally, 
      several reasons related to discomfort of use were itemized, but the musicians who 
      consistently used their earplugs did so in spite of problems with use. The REAT 
      values obtained in sound field were relatively close to the manufacturer's 
      nominal specifications, being 13.7 dB, on average. In the frequency range studied 
      (0.125-8 kHz), individual variation in REAT was, however, up to 15 dB across the 
      measured frequencies. Fluctuation in attenuation might be related to low use of 
      hearing protectors, and REAT measured at fixed center frequencies may be too 
      robust a method to uncover it. We therefore tested 10 additional subjects to find 
      out whether a sweeping signal used in Bιkιsy audiometry would bring more detailed 
      information on earplug attenuation. Mean attenuation was found to be somewhat 
      closer to the nominal attenuation of the ER-9 and ER-15 earplugs up to about 1 
      kHz, whereas REAT measurements in sound field revealed more even attenuation at 
      frequencies between 1 and 6 kHz. No significant association was found between 
      earplug attenuation properties and earplug use. It was concluded that support and 
      determination to get accustomed to hearing protector use are important factors in 
      hearing conservation.

TI  - Why Do People Like Loud Sound? A Qualitative Study.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph14080908 [doi]
LID - 908
AB  - Many people choose to expose themselves to potentially dangerous sounds such as 
      loud music, either via speakers, personal audio systems, or at clubs. The 
      Conditioning, Adaptation and Acculturation to Loud Music (CAALM) Model has 
      proposed a theoretical basis for this behaviour. To compare the model to data, we 
      interviewed a group of people who were either regular nightclub-goers or who 
      controlled the sound levels in nightclubs (bar managers, musicians, DJs, and 
      sound engineers) about loud sound. Results showed four main themes relating to 
      the enjoyment of loud sound: arousal/excitement, facilitation of socialisation, 
      masking of both external sound and unwanted thoughts, and an emphasis and 
      enhancement of personal identity. Furthermore, an interesting incidental finding 
      was that sound levels appeared to increase gradually over the course of the 
      evening until they plateaued at approximately 97 dBA Leq around midnight. 
      Consideration of the data generated by the analysis revealed a complex of 
      influential factors that support people in wanting exposure to loud sound. 
      Findings were considered in terms of the CAALM Model and could be explained in 
      terms of its principles. From a health promotion perspective, the Social 
      Ecological Model was applied to consider how the themes identified might 
      influence behaviour. They were shown to influence people on multiple levels, 
      providing a powerful system which health promotion approaches struggle to 
      address.

TI  - Student's music exposure: Full-day personal dose measurements.
PG  - 98-103
LID - 10.4103/1463-1741.178510 [doi]
AB  - Previous studies have shown that collegiate level music students are exposed to 
      potentially hazardous sound levels. Compared to professional musicians, 
      collegiate level music students typically do not perform as frequently, but they 
      are exposed to intense sounds during practice and rehearsal sessions. The purpose 
      of the study was to determine the full-day exposure dose including individual 
      practice and ensemble rehearsals for collegiate student musicians. Sixty-seven 
      college students of classical music were recruited representing 17 primary 
      instruments. Of these students, 57 completed 2 days of noise dose measurements 
      using Cirrus doseBadge programed according to the National Institute for 
      Occupational Safety and Health criterion. Sound exposure was measured for 2 days 
      from morning to evening, ranging from 7 to 9 h. Twenty-eight out of 57 (49%) 
      student musicians exceeded a 100% daily noise dose on at least 1 day of the two 
      measurement days. Eleven student musicians (19%) exceeded 100% daily noise dose 
      on both days. Fourteen students exceeded 100% dose during large ensemble 
      rehearsals and eight students exceeded 100% dose during individual practice 
      sessions. Approximately, half of the student musicians exceeded 100% noise dose 
      on a typical college schedule. This finding indicates that a large proportion of 
      collegiate student musicians are at risk of developing noise-induced hearing loss 
      due to hazardous sound levels. Considering the current finding, there is a need 
      to conduct hearing conservation programs in all music schools, and to educate 
      student musicians about the use and importance of hearing protection devices for 
      their hearing.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Physical demands, exposure to noise and intense contact of skin with 
      musical instruments - inevitable in musicians' job - influence the development of 
      musculoskeletal, hearing and skin problems. This paper aims at identifying 
      playing-related health problems among Polish musicians and potential differences 
      in this regard between students and professional musicians. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 
      This questionnaire study involved 255 musicians who volunteered to participate - 
      104 students and 151 professional musicians having music education. The study 
      sample included 61% of women. Mean age of the participants equaled 31 years old, 
      mean playing experience - 23 years old. RESULTS: From 10% to 79% (depending on 
      the affected body part) of the studied musicians experienced musculoskeletal 
      problems. Hearing (41% - tinnitus; 43% - hearing impairment and 52% - 
      hyperacusis) and skin problems (69% - callosities, 58% - abrasions and 26% - 
      allergic reactions) were reported less frequently and were assessed as less 
      severe than musculoskeletal symptoms. The studied professionals assessed their 
      hearing problems (hyperacusis, hearing impairment and tinnitus) as significantly 
      more severe than reported by students. Young musicians, in turn, experienced more 
      severe abrasions than the studied professional musicians. We found no significant 
      differences between students and professionals as regards their musculoskeletal 
      problems. CONCLUSIONS: Playing-related health risks translate into relatively 
      high prevalence of musculoskeletal as well as hearing and skin problems among 
      musicians. Hence, it is essential for future studies to search for risk factors 
      for these health problems as well as effective corrective and therapeutic 
      measures. Med Pr 2018;69(4):383-394.

TI  - Musicians' Earplugs: Do They Affect Performance or Listeners' Perceptions?
PG  - 188-195
LID - 10.21091/mppa.2020.4027 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Does wearing musicians' earplugs while performing affect the quality 
      of the performance? Can listeners perceive a difference in sound when musicians 
      are performing with or without earplugs? The risk of hearing loss is a concern 
      for musicians, but some are reluctant to wear hearing protection due to factors 
      such as an inability to hear their own instrument properly and the possibility of 
      decreased sound quality for listeners. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was 
      to determine the effect of musicians' earplugs on instrumental pitch accuracy and 
      the perception of tone quality, intonation, and dynamic contrast, as perceived by 
      musicians and listeners. METHODS: Ten university studio faculty teachers were 
      recorded performing single pitches and lyrical and technical passages, first 
      without earplugs and then immediately after with earplugs. A sample of 8 studio 
      faculty teachers and 88 undergraduate music education students completed a 
      researcher-created music perception test of tone quality, intonation, and dynamic 
      contrast. RESULTS: Objective analyses of the single pitch recordings made by 
      faculty with and without earplugs indicate that pitch accuracy did not favor 
      either condition consistently. Results from the perception test indicate that 
      although both faculty and student listeners perceived some differences, the most 
      frequent perception was that the audio pair was equal, and there was no clear 
      difference between performing with and without earplugs in terms of tone quality, 
      intonation, or dynamic contrast. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that 
      musicians should feel confident that wearing musicians' earplugs while performing 
      does not adversely affect pitch accuracy or listeners' perceptions of their 
      timbre and dynamic control.

      musicians: a basis for designing interventions to promote uptake and sustained 
      use.
PG  - 463-472
LID - 10.1080/14992027.2021.1951852 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The current study aimed to: i) determine the patterns of hearing 
      protection device (HPD) use in early-career musicians, ii) identify barriers to 
      and facilitators of HPD use, and iii) use the Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW) to 
      develop an intervention to increase uptake and sustained use of HPDs. DESIGN: A 
      mixed-methods approach using questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. STUDY 
      SAMPLE: Eighty early-career musicians (age range = 18-26 years; women n = 39), 
      across all categories of musical instrument. RESULTS: 42.5% percent of 
      participants reported using HPDs at least once a week, 35% less than once a week, 
      and 22.5% reported never using HPDs for music-related activities. Six barriers 
      and four facilitators of HPD use were identified. Barriers include the impact of 
      HPDs on listening to music and performing, and a lack of concern about noise 
      exposure. Barriers/facilitators were mapped onto the Theoretical Domains 
      Framework. Following the systematic process of the BCW, our proposed intervention 
      strategies are based on 'Environmental Restructuring', such as providing prompts 
      to increase awareness of noisy settings, and 'Persuasion/Modelling', such as 
      providing credible role models. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, the present 
      study demonstrates the use of the BCW for designing interventions in the context 
      of hearing conservation.

AB  - In the present study, we evaluated peripheral and central auditory pathways in 
      professional musicians (with and without hearing loss) compared to non-musicians. 
      The goal was to verify if music exposure could affect auditory pathways as a 
      whole. This is a prospective study that compared the results obtained between 
      three groups (musicians with and without hearing loss and non-musicians). 
      Thirty-two male individuals participated and they were assessed by: Immittance 
      measurements, pure-tone air conduction thresholds at all frequencies from 0.25 to 
      20 kHz, Transient Evoked Otoacoustic Emissions, Auditory Brainstem Response 
      (ABR), and Cognitive Potential. The musicians showed worse hearing thresholds in 
      both conventional and high frequency audiometry when compared to the 
      non-musicians; the mean amplitude of Transient Evoked Otoacoustic Emissions was 
      smaller in the musicians group, but the mean latencies of Auditory Brainstem 
      Response and Cognitive Potential were diminished in the musicians when compared 
      to the non-musicians. Our findings suggest that the population of musicians is at 
      risk for developing music-induced hearing loss. However, the electrophysiological 
      evaluation showed that latency waves of ABR and P300 were diminished in 
      musicians, which may suggest that the auditory training to which these musicians 
      are exposed acts as a facilitator of the acoustic signal transmission to the 
      cortex.

TI  - Factors influencing use of hearing protection by trumpet players.
PG  - 173-8
LID - 10.1177/1084713812468514 [doi]
AB  - Although a great many brass players, and trumpet players in particular, 
      successfully use high-fidelity earplugs, others report problems with their use. 
      This article discusses factors that may discourage a brass player from using 
      hearing protection: These include (a) a lack of acclimatization time; (b) a loss 
      of "fortissimo blare" from the aural distortion generated by the 110- to 120-dB 
      SPL produced at the open ear with fortissimo playing; (c) a shallow earmold seal, 
      leading to a large occlusion effect; (d) a poor seal combined with incorrect 
      acoustic mass in the sound channel; and (e) hearing loss where many harmonic 
      overtones of even moderately loud playing may become inaudible with earplugs to a 
      lifelong trumpet player with high-frequency hearing loss. The limitations imposed 
      by each of these can usually be overcome with modifications of the hearing 
      protection device (HPD) or with acclimatization time, allowing a lifetime of 
      playing without the all-too-common "musicians' hearing loss" and/or tinnitus. A 
      review of these factors helps to delineate some of the perceptual issues that 
      musicians may have with any change in the spectrum of their instrument-whether it 
      is related to attenuation or amplification.

AB  - The Sound Practice Project is a 5-year study involving baseline evaluation, 
      development, and implementation of musician-specific work health and safety 
      initiatives. A cross-sectional population physical and psychological survey and 
      physical assessment were conducted at the same time, with an auditory health 
      assessment conducted later. The results were used to guide the development of a 
      series of targeted interventions, encompassing physical, psychological, and 
      auditory health components. This paper provides an overview of the project but 
      focuses on the health findings arising from the cross-sectional survey. Three 
      hundred and seventy-seven musicians from the eight professional symphony 
      orchestras in Australia took part in the cross-sectional study (about 70% of 
      eligible musicians). Eighty-four percent (84%) of musicians reported past 
      performance-related musculoskeletal disorder (PRMD) episodes; 50% were suffering 
      a current PRMD. Of the 63% who returned hearing surveys, 43% believed they had 
      hearing loss, and 64% used earplugs at least intermittently. Noise exposure was 
      found to be high in private practice, although awareness of risk and earplug use 
      in this environment was lower than in orchestral settings. Improved strategic 
      approaches, acoustic screens and recently developed active earplugs were found to 
      provide effective new options for hearing protection. With respect to 
      psychosocial screening, female musicians reported significantly more trait 
      anxiety, music performance anxiety, social anxiety, and other forms of anxiety 
      and depression than male musicians. The youngest musicians were significantly 
      more anxious compared with the oldest musicians. Thirty-three percent (33%) of 
      musicians may meet criteria for a diagnosis of social phobia; 32% returned a 
      positive depression screen and 22% for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). 
      PRMDs and trigger point discomfort levels were strongly associated with 
      increasing severity of psychological issues such as depression and music 
      performance anxiety.

TI  - Practices and Attitudes That Enhance Music Engagement of Adult Cochlear Implant 
      Users.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cochlear implants (CIs) are auditory prostheses designed to support 
      spoken communication in persons with severe to profound hearing loss. Many 
      post-lingually deaf adult CI users achieve good speech recognition in quiet; 
      unfortunately, CI technology conveys a degraded representation of pitch and 
      timbre, essential components of music. Not surprisingly, most CI users achieve 
      significantly poorer perception and enjoyment of music compared with normal 
      hearing listeners. Anecdotal evidence indicates that this impacts music 
      engagement, particularly singing and playing instruments requiring ongoing tuning 
      to external pitches or producing intervallic ratios. Interestingly, a small 
      cohort of adult CI users has shown remarkable success in recovering or developing 
      musical skills, but their success is poorly understood. Greater understanding of 
      their efforts and attitudes may suggest potential rehabilitative approaches for 
      other CI users. PURPOSE: This article documented personal characteristics and 
      experiences perceived to contribute to high level musicianship. Research 
      questions included: (1) What forms of practice/experience have most contributed 
      to (re)establishing satisfying music making? (2) What situations or musical tasks 
      are most frustrating or challenging? (3) What attitudes, motivational factors, or 
      forms of support help CI users persist in working toward improved music 
      engagement? METHODS: Qualitative and patient-engaged research methodologies were 
      used. Our study involved a unique collaboration of six CI users engaged in high 
      levels of musicianship and a researcher whose scholarship focuses on music and 
      CIs. The CI recipients conveyed their experiences and attitudes regarding music 
      and CIs through open-ended narratives. These narratives were analyzed using an 
      integrative approach of inductive and deductive coding methods. The codes and 
      themes that emerged through inductive methods were then organized within the 
      Dynamic Problem Solving Model for Management of Music Listening Environments 
      (Gfeller et al., 2019a). OUTCOMES: This paper provides reflections of six CI 
      users who successfully engage in active music making, including on-going tuning 
      to external pitches and ensemble participation. Their perspectives emphasize the 
      importance of pre-CI music instruction, extensive practice and immersion in music 
      listening and playing, persistence and self-efficacy, and problem solving skills 
      that optimize music engagement, and suggest possible strategies useful to other 
      CI users interested in improving music experiences.

TI  - Auditory thresholds among military musicians: conventional and high frequency.
PG  - 181-7
LID - S2317-17822013000200015 [pii]
AB  - PURPOSE: To analyze and characterize tonal auditory thresholds between 500 Hz and 
      16,000 Hz of professional musicians, specifically members of a military band. 
      METHODS: A historic cohort study was carried out comparing one group of 50 
      professional musicians (military band) with another group (44 subjects) without 
      history of professional exposure to intense sound; the groups were homogenous 
      (p<0.05%) in relation to gender (male) and age (about 35 years old). Tone 
      threshold audiometry for conventional (from 500 to 8,000 Hz) and high frequencies 
      was applied (from 9,000 to 16,000 Hz). RESULTS: Exposure to music triggered 
      permanent hearing impairment. As to conventional auditory thresholds, the exposed 
      and non-exposed groups presented sensorineural hearing loss of 32 and 2.27%, 
      respectively. The subjects exposed to music had 14.54 times more risks of 
      acquiring sensorineural hearing loss than the non-exposed group. After 20 years 
      of exposure to music, significant worsening was observed in auditory thresholds, 
      especially at extended high frequencies, and differences occurred between the 
      groups from the age of 30 on. CONCLUSION: Exposure to music caused permanent 
      hearing impairment, showing differences in relation to the non-exposed group, 
      registered in conventional audiometry and at high-frequency audiometry.

TI  - Prevalence of high frequency hearing loss consistent with noise exposure among 
      people working with sound systems and general population in Brazil: a 
      cross-sectional study.
PG  - 151
LID - 10.1186/1471-2458-8-151 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Music is ever present in our daily lives, establishing a link between 
      humans and the arts through the senses and pleasure. Sound technicians are the 
      link between musicians and audiences or consumers. Recently, general concern has 
      arisen regarding occurrences of hearing loss induced by noise from excessively 
      amplified sound-producing activities within leisure and professional 
      environments. Sound technicians' activities expose them to the risk of hearing 
      loss, and consequently put at risk their quality of life, the quality of the 
      musical product and consumers' hearing. The aim of this study was to measure the 
      prevalence of high frequency hearing loss consistent with noise exposure among 
      sound technicians in Brazil and compare this with a control group without 
      occupational noise exposure. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study comparing 
      177 participants in two groups: 82 sound technicians and 95 controls (non-sound 
      technicians). A questionnaire on music listening habits and associated complaints 
      was applied, and data were gathered regarding the professionals' numbers of 
      working hours per day and both groups' hearing complaint and presence of 
      tinnitus. The participants' ear canals were visually inspected using an otoscope. 
      Hearing assessments were performed (tonal and speech audiometry) using a portable 
      digital AD 229 E audiometer funded by FAPESP. RESULTS: There was no statistically 
      significant difference between the sound technicians and controls regarding age 
      and gender. Thus, the study sample was homogenous and would be unlikely to lead 
      to bias in the results. A statistically significant difference in hearing loss 
      was observed between the groups: 50% among the sound technicians and 10.5% among 
      the controls. The difference could be addressed to high sound levels. CONCLUSION: 
      The sound technicians presented a higher prevalence of high frequency hearing 
      loss consistent with noise exposure than did the general population, although the 
      possibility of residual confounding due to unmeasured factors such as 
      socioeconomic status cannot be ruled out.

TI  - Differences in Perception of Musical Stimuli among Acoustic, Electric, and 
      Combined Modality Listeners.
PG  - 494-501
LID - 10.3766/jaaa.14098 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cochlear implants have shown vast improvements in speech 
      understanding for those with severe to profound hearing loss; however, music 
      perception remains a challenge for electric hearing. It is unclear whether the 
      difficulties arise from limitations of sound processing, the nature of a damaged 
      auditory system, or a combination of both. PURPOSE: To examine music perception 
      performance with different acoustic and electric hearing configurations. RESEARCH 
      DESIGN: Chord discrimination and timbre perception were tested in subjects 
      representing four daily-use listening configurations: unilateral cochlear implant 
      (CI), contralateral bimodal (CIHA), bilateral hearing aid (HAHA) and 
      normal-hearing (NH) listeners. A same-different task was used for discrimination 
      of two chords played on piano. Timbre perception was assessed using a 
      10-instrument forced-choice identification task. STUDY SAMPLE: Fourteen adults 
      were included in each group, none of whom were professional musicians. DATA 
      COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The number of correct responses was divided by the total 
      number of presentations to calculate scores in percent correct. Data analyses 
      were performed with Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance and linear 
      regression. RESULTS: Chord discrimination showed a narrow range of performance 
      across groups, with mean scores ranging between 72.5% (CI) and 88.9% (NH). 
      Significant differences were seen between the NH and all hearing-impaired groups. 
      Both the HAHA and CIHA groups performed significantly better than the CI groups, 
      and no significant differences were observed between the HAHA and CIHA groups. 
      Timbre perception was significantly poorer for the hearing-impaired groups (mean 
      scores ranged from 50.3-73.9%) compared to NH (95.2%). Significantly better 
      performance was observed in the HAHA group as compared to both groups with 
      electric hearing (CI and CIHA). There was no significant difference in 
      performance between the CIHA and CI groups. Timbre perception was a significantly 
      more difficult task than chord discrimination for both the CI and CIHA groups, 
      yet the easier task for the NH group. A significant difference between the two 
      tasks was not seen in the HAHA group. CONCLUSIONS: Having impaired hearing 
      decreases performance compared to NH across both chord discrimination and timbre 
      perception tasks. For chord discrimination, having acoustic hearing improved 
      performance compared to electric hearing only. Timbre perception distinguished 
      those with acoustic hearing from those with electric hearing. Those with 
      bilateral acoustic hearing, even if damaged, performed significantly better on 
      this task than those requiring electrical stimulation, which may indicate that CI 
      sound processing fails to capture and deliver the necessary acoustic cues for 
      timbre perception. Further analysis of timbre characteristics in electric hearing 
      may contribute to advancements in programming strategies to obtain optimal 
      hearing outcomes.

TI  - Hearing in nonprofessional pop/rock musicians.
PG  - 321-30
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the hearing and subjective 
      auditory symptoms in a group of nonprofessional pop/rock musicians who had 
      experienced repeated exposures to intense sound levels during at least 5 yr of 
      musical activity. DESIGN: An evaluation of both ears in 42 nonprofessional 
      pop/rock musicians included pure-tone audiometry in the conventional and extended 
      high-frequency range, the measurement of uncomfortable loudness levels, and an 
      assessment of tinnitus and hypersensitivity to sound. Exclusion criteria were (a) 
      the occurrence of acoustic trauma, (b) excessive noise exposure during 
      occupational activities, (c) a history of recurrent otitis media, (d) previous 
      ear surgery, (e) a fracture of the cranium, (f) ingestion of potentially ototoxic 
      drugs, and (g) reported hearing difficulties within the immediate family. These 
      audiometric results were then compared with a control group of 20 otologically 
      normal young adults with no history of long-term noise exposure. RESULTS: After 
      adjusting for age and gender, relative to ISO 7029, the mean hearing threshold in 
      the frequency range of 3 to 8 kHz was 6 dB in the musicians and 1.5 dB in the 
      control group. This difference was statistically significant (Mann-Whitney rank 
      sum test, p < 0.001). A significant difference was also observed between 
      musicians using regular hearing protection during their activities (average 3 to 
      8 kHz thresholds = 2.4 dB) and musicians who never used such hearing protection 
      (average 3 to 8 kHz thresholds = 8.2 dB), after adjusting for age and gender 
      (Mann-Whitney rank sum test, p = 0.006). Eleven of the musicians (26%) were found 
      to be hypersensitive to sound, and seven (17%) presented with tinnitus. Tinnitus 
      assessment, however, did not reveal any clinically significant psychological 
      distress in these individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Tinnitus and hypersensitivity to 
      sound were observed in a significant minority within a group of nonprofessional 
      pop/rock musicians who had experienced repeated exposure to intense sound levels 
      over at least 5 yr but with minimal impact on their lives. Moreover, hearing loss 
      was minimal in the subjects who always used ear protection, being only 0.9 dB 
      higher than the control group. In contrast, hearing loss was significantly more 
      pronounced, at 6.7 dB higher than the control group, in those musicians who never 
      used ear protection. Continued education about the risk to hearing and the 
      benefits of the persistent use of ear protection is warranted for musicians who 
      are exposed frequently to intense sound levels.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The present study compared wave I amplitude of auditory brainstem 
      responses (ABRs), a potential indicator of cochlear synaptopathy, among musicians 
      and non-musicians with normal audiograms. DESIGN: Noise exposure background (NEB) 
      was evaluated using an online questionnaire. Two-channel ABRs were recorded from 
      the left ear using click stimuli. One channel utilized an ipsilateral tiptrode, 
      and another channel utilized an ipsilateral mastoid electrode. ABRs were 
      collected at 90, 75, and 60 dBnHL. A mixed model was used to analyze the effect 
      of group, electrodes, and stimulus levels on ABR wave I amplitude. STUDY SAMPLE: 
      75 collegiate students with normal hearing participated in the study and were 
      grouped into a non-music major group (n = 25), a brass major group (n = 25), and 
      a voice major group (n = 25). RESULTS: The NEB was negatively associated with the 
      action potential (AP) and ABR wave I amplitude for click intensity levels at 75 
      dBnHL. The mean amplitude of the ABR wave I was not significantly different 
      between the three groups. CONCLUSION: The weak negative association of AP and ABR 
      wave I amplitude with NEB cannot be solely attributed to evidence of cochlear 
      synaptopathy in humans as the possibility of hair cell damage cannot be ruled 
      out. Future research should investigate the effects of reduced cochlear output on 
      the supra-threshold speech processing abilities of student musicians.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Preferences between low delays and phase-frequency responses of 
      behind-the-ear, open-canal hearing aids were investigated with acoustic 
      conditions deemed sensitive to delay effects by normal-hearing listeners. DESIGN: 
      Hearing aids with the following selectable delay and phase response options were 
      fitted at low insertion gain: (1) 1.4 ms delay, minimum phase; (2) 3.4 ms delay, 
      minimum phase; and (3) 3.4 ms delay, linear phase. Blind paired comparisons were 
      made between processing options and between each option and a muted hearing-aid 
      output with two music stimuli. The three alternative forced choice responses were 
      "Slightly prefer", "Prefer", or "Strongly prefer". STUDY SAMPLE: Twelve 
      hearing-impaired musicians. RESULTS: At the 3.4-ms delay, the minimum-phase 
      response was significantly preferred to the linear-phase response for one music 
      sample and vice-versa for the other sample with a sign test (p < 0.04) but not a 
      Wilcoxon signed rank test that accounted for the low preference strength. 
      Preferences between all other processing conditions were not significant. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In acoustic conditions sensitive to delay effects, delays of 1.4 or 
      3.4 ms were either not detected or no less preferable than no delayed aided 
      signal. It is unclear whether different phase-frequency responses may be 
      preferred with different music stimuli.

AB  - There are barriers to effective hearing protection among musicians. AIM: To 
      investigate the acceptance of hearing protection aids in members of an 
      instrumental and voice music band. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A prospective study of 34 
      members of the Municipal Indaial Band. Sound pressure levels were measured during 
      a rehearsal, indicating mean levels ranging from 96.4 dB(A) to 106.9 dB(A). 
      Subjects answered questionnaires and underwent audiometry. They attended a 
      lecture in which folders and hearing protection aids were provided; subjects were 
      asked to try using the protectors for 3 months. RESULTS: At the end of the study 
      period, 56.2% reported not liking hearing protection, while 43.7 % accepted such 
      protection. The most common complaints were discomfort with sounds (58.8 %) and 
      tinnitus (47%). 77.1% said that music might cause hearing impairment. A 
      statistically significant difference was observed in the right ear at 4 and 6 kHz 
      and at the left ear in 3, 4 and 6 kHz when median thresholds were compared with 
      those from unexposed controls. CONCLUSION: Although most subjects seemed aware of 
      the risk, few took preventive measures against hearing loss. This suggests the 
      need for periodic educational campaigns and specific legislation tailored to 
      music professionals.

AB  - This study aimed to determine (a) the influence of noise exposure background 
      (NEB) on the peripheral and central auditory system functioning and (b) the 
      influence of NEB on speech recognition in noise abilities in student musicians. 
      Twenty non-musician students with self-reported low NEB and 18 student musicians 
      with self-reported high NEB completed a battery of tests that consisted of 
      physiological measures, including auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) at three 
      different stimulus rates (11.3 Hz, 51.3 Hz, and 81.3 Hz), and P300, and 
      behavioral measures including conventional and extended high-frequency 
      audiometry, consonant-vowel nucleus-consonant (CNC) word test and AzBio sentence 
      test for assessing speech perception in noise abilities at -9, -6, -3, 0, and +3 
      dB signal to noise ratios (SNRs). The NEB was negatively associated with 
      performance on the CNC test at all five SNRs. A negative association was found 
      between NEB and performance on the AzBio test at 0 dB SNR. No effect of NEB was 
      found on the amplitude and latency of P300 and the ABR wave I amplitude. More 
      investigations of larger datasets with different NEB and longitudinal 
      measurements are needed to investigate the influence of NEB on word recognition 
      in noise and to understand the specific cognitive processes contributing to the 
      impact of NEB on word recognition in noise.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It has been shown that musicians are at risk of noise-induced hearing 
      loss. The aim of the study has been to evaluate the temporary changes of hearing 
      in the case of orchestral musicians after group rehearsals. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 
      The study group comprised 18 orchestral musicians, aged 30-58 years old (mean: 40 
      years old) having 12-40 years (mean: 22 years) of professional experience. The 
      temporary changes in hearing after group rehearsals were determined using 
      transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs). Noise exposures during group 
      rehearsals were also evaluated. RESULTS: Musicians' hearing threshold levels were 
      higher (worse) than expected for the equivalent non-noise-exposed population. 
      Moreover, the high frequency notched audiograms were observed in some of them. 
      After rehearsals, during which musicians were exposed to orchestral noise at 
      A-weighted equivalent-continuous sound pressure level (normalized to 8-h working 
      day) varied from 75.6-83.1 dB (mean: 79.4 dB). The significant post-exposure 
      reductions of TEOAE amplitudes (approx. 0.7 dB) both for the total response and 
      frequency bands of 2000 and 3000 Hz were noted. However, there were no 
      significant differences between pre- and postexposure reproducibility of TEOAE. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Obtained results have confirmed that orchestral musicians are at 
      risk of hearing loss due to their professional activities, even at exposures to 
      orchestral noise less than the limit values for occupational noise.

TI  - Noise exposure levels for musicians during rehearsal and performance times.
PG  - 31-6
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine daily noise doses and 
      8-hour time weighted averages for rock band musicians, crew members, and 
      spectators during a typical rehearsal and performance using both Occupational 
      Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and National Institute of Occupational 
      Safety and Health (NIOSH) measurement criteria. DESIGN: Personal noise dosimetry 
      was completed on five members of a rock band during one 2-hr rehearsal and one 
      4-hr performance. Time-weighted averages (TWA) and daily dose values were 
      calculated using both OSHA and NIOSH criteria and compared to industry guidelines 
      for enrollment in hearing conservation programs and the use of hearing protection 
      devices. RESULTS: TWA values ranged from 84.3 to 90.4 dBA (OSHA) and from 90.0 to 
      96.4 dBA (NIOSH) during the rehearsal. The same values ranged from 91.0 to 99.7 
      dBA (OSHA) and 94.0 to 102.8 dBA (NIOSH) for the performance. During the 
      rehearsal, daily noise doses ranged from 45.54% to 106.7% (OSHA) and from 317.74% 
      to 1396.07% (NIOSH). During the performance, doses ranged from 114.66% to 382.49% 
      (OSHA) and from 793.31% to 5970.15% (NIOSH). CONCLUSIONS: The musicians in this 
      study were exposed to dangerously high levels of noise and should be enrolled in 
      a hearing conservation programs. Hearing protection devices should be worn, 
      especially during performances. The OSHA measurement criteria yielded values 
      significantly more conservative than those produced by NIOSH criteria. 
      Audiologists should counsel musician-patients about the hazards of excessive 
      noise (music) exposure and how to protect their hearing.

TI  - The musician effect: does it persist under degraded pitch conditions of cochlear 
      implant simulations?
PG  - 179

AB  - Cochlear implants (CIs) are auditory prostheses that restore hearing via 
      electrical stimulation of the auditory nerve. Compared to normal acoustic 
      hearing, sounds transmitted through the CI are spectro-temporally degraded, 
      causing difficulties in challenging listening tasks such as speech 
      intelligibility in noise and perception of music. In normal hearing (NH), 
      musicians have been shown to better perform than non-musicians in auditory 
      processing and perception, especially for challenging listening tasks. This 
      "musician effect" was attributed to better processing of pitch cues, as well as 
      better overall auditory cognitive functioning in musicians. Does the musician 
      effect persist when pitch cues are degraded, as it would be in signals 
      transmitted through a CI? To answer this question, NH musicians and non-musicians 
      were tested while listening to unprocessed signals or to signals processed by an 
      acoustic CI simulation. The task increasingly depended on pitch perception: (1) 
      speech intelligibility (words and sentences) in quiet or in noise, (2) vocal 
      emotion identification, and (3) melodic contour identification (MCI). For speech 
      perception, there was no musician effect with the unprocessed stimuli, and a 
      small musician effect only for word identification in one noise condition, in the 
      CI simulation. For emotion identification, there was a small musician effect for 
      both. For MCI, there was a large musician effect for both. Overall, the effect 
      was stronger as the importance of pitch in the listening task increased. This 
      suggests that the musician effect may be more rooted in pitch perception, rather 
      than in a global advantage in cognitive processing (in which musicians would have 
      performed better in all tasks). The results further suggest that musical training 
      before (and possibly after) implantation might offer some advantage in pitch 
      processing that could partially benefit speech perception, and more strongly 
      emotion and music perception.

TI  - Tinnitus Severity Is Related to the Sound Exposure of Symphony Orchestra 
      Musicians Independently of Hearing Impairment.
PG  - 88-97
LID - 10.1097/AUD.0000000000000594 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Tinnitus can be debilitating and with great impact of musicians 
      professional and private life. The objectives of the study were therefore to: (1) 
      describe the epidemiology of tinnitus including its severity in classical 
      orchestra musicians, (2) investigate the association between tinnitus severity in 
      classical musicians and their cumulative lifetime sound exposure, and (3) the 
      association between tinnitus and hearing thresholds. DESIGN: The study population 
      included all musicians from five Danish symphony orchestras. Answers regarding 
      their perception of tinnitus were received from 325 musicians, and 212 musicians 
      were also tested with audiometry. Any tinnitus and severe tinnitus were two 
      definitions of tinnitus used as outcomes and analyzed in relation to an 
      estimation of the cumulative lifetime sound exposure from sound measurements and 
      previously validated questionnaires and the average hearing threshold of 3, 4, 
      and 6 kHz. RESULTS: Thirty-five percentage of all musicians (31% female and 38% 
      of male musicians) reported having experienced at least one episode of tinnitus 
      lasting for more than 5 minutes during their life. Severe tinnitus with a severe 
      impact on daily life was reported by 19% of the musicians (18% of female and 21% 
      of male musicians). The severity of tinnitus was associated with increased 
      lifetime sound exposure but not to poorer high frequency hearing thresholds when 
      the lifetime sound exposure was considered. The odds ratio for an increase in one 
      unit of tinnitus severity was 1.25 (95% CI, 1.12-1.40) for every 1 dB increase in 
      lifetime sound exposure. CONCLUSION: Musicians frequently report tinnitus. Any 
      tinnitus and severe tinnitus are significantly associated with the cumulative 
      lifetime sound exposure, which was shown to be the most important factor not only 
      for the prevalence but also for the severity of tinnitus-even in musicians 
      without hearing loss. High-frequency hearing thresholds and tinnitus severity 
      were correlated only if the cumulative lifetime sound exposure was excluded from 
      the analyses.

PG  - 927-39
LID - 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2008.12.045 [doi]
AB  - The neural basis of tinnitus is unknown. Recent neuroimaging studies point 
      towards involvement of several cortical and subcortical regions. Here we 
      demonstrate that tinnitus may be associated with structural changes in the 
      auditory cortex. Using individual morphological segmentation, the medial 
      partition of Heschl's gyrus (mHG) was studied in individuals with and without 
      chronic tinnitus using magnetic resonance imaging. Both the tinnitus and the 
      non-tinnitus group included musicians and non-musicians. Patients exhibited 
      significantly smaller mHG gray matter volumes than controls. In unilateral 
      tinnitus, this effect was almost exclusively seen in the hemisphere ipsilateral 
      to the affected ear. In bilateral tinnitus, mHG volume was substantially reduced 
      in both hemispheres. The tinnitus-related volume reduction was found across the 
      full extent of mHG, not only in the high-frequency part usually most affected by 
      hearing loss-induced deafferentation. However, there was also evidence for a 
      relationship between volume reduction and hearing loss. Correlations between 
      volume and hearing level depended on the subject group as well as the asymmetry 
      of the hearing loss. The volume changes observed may represent antecedents or 
      consequences of tinnitus and tinnitus-associated hearing loss and also raise the 
      possibility that small cortical volume constitutes a vulnerability factor.

AB  - Our ability to listen selectively to single sound sources in complex auditory 
      environments is termed "auditory stream segregation."This ability is affected by 
      peripheral disorders such as hearing loss, as well as plasticity in central 
      processing such as occurs with musical training. Brain plasticity induced by 
      musical training can enhance the ability to segregate sound, leading to 
      improvements in a variety of auditory abilities. The melody segregation ability 
      of 12 cochlear-implant recipients was tested using a new method to determine the 
      perceptual distance needed to segregate a simple 4-note melody from a background 
      of interleaved random-pitch distractor notes. In experiment 1, participants rated 
      the difficulty of segregating the melody from distracter notes. Four physical 
      properties of the distracter notes were changed. In experiment 2, listeners were 
      asked to rate the dissimilarity between melody patterns whose notes differed on 
      the four physical properties simultaneously. Multidimensional scaling analysis 
      transformed the dissimilarity ratings into perceptual distances. Regression 
      between physical and perceptual cues then derived the minimal perceptual distance 
      needed to segregate the melody. The most efficient streaming cue for CI users was 
      loudness. For the normal hearing listeners without musical backgrounds, a greater 
      difference on the perceptual dimension correlated to the temporal envelope is 
      needed for stream segregation in CI users. No differences in streaming efficiency 
      were found between the perceptual dimensions linked to the F0 and the spectral 
      envelope. Combined with our previous results in normally-hearing musicians and 
      non-musicians, the results show that differences in training as well as 
      differences in peripheral auditory processing (hearing impairment and the use of 
      a hearing device) influences the way that listeners use different acoustic cues 
      for segregating interleaved musical streams.

LID - 76
AB  - Background: Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is one of the most common causes of 
      sensorineural hearing loss. The prevention of NIHL in musicians requires a better 
      understanding of its contributing exposure factors. We aimed to determine typical 
      sound exposure levels received by professional musicians during solitary practice 
      and calculate the maximum safe practice time (MSPT) for the main Iranian musical 
      instruments. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study on 185 professional 
      musicians (147 men and 38 women) between April 2018 and April 2019. The MSPT was 
      calculated for each instrument if the mean sound level was below 85 dB in all 
      musicians, and the music was considered a safe instrument; if it was >85 dB, it 
      was considered a high-risk instruments and some other instruments had different 
      mean sound level (in some participants <85 dB and some other players >85 dB), so 
      these instruments were considered as borderline instruments. Results: The mean 
      age of the participants was 36.66 ± 0.85 years and their mean daily practice time 
      was 2.89 ± 0.13 hours. The daily practice was significantly higher in plucked 
      string instruments as compared to other instruments (p<0.001). The mean sound 
      level of every instrument varied from 67.77 to 100.77 dB in the right ear and 
      67.20 to 100.12 dB in the left ear. The highest sound level was in sorna and the 
      lowest one in zanburak. Conclusion: It seems musicians observe the MSPT of each 
      instrument as much as possible. It is recommended to determine the comprehensive 
      protocol for each instrument to prevent hearing loss in musicians.

AB  - High-fidelity premolded earplugs (HiFi HPDs) are designed to provide relatively 
      uniform attenuation across frequencies. The primary goal of this study was to 
      verify the amount and flatness of individual user attenuation. HiFi HPD 
      attenuation was measured using real-ear attenuation at threshold (REAT) 
      measurements under circumaural earphones. Participants were 16 adults tested 
      using commercial HiFi HPDs marketed for use at recreational music events and/or 
      for use by musicians. There was significant individual variation in attenuation 
      both within and across HiFi HPD brands. In addition to significant differences in 
      achieved attenuation, there were significant differences in the uniformity of the 
      attenuation. These data suggest verification of attenuation is important in 
      musicians who are at risk for music-induced hearing disorders even when using 
      "over-the-counter" uniform-fit HPDs.

AB  - Musicians in symphony orchestras are exposed to harmful sound levels. Although 
      research shows that industrial workers have a higher propensity to noise-induced 
      hearing loss, musicians can also develop a hearing loss from noise exposure. 
      Furthermore, musicians can suffer from tinnitus, hyperacusis, and distortion, 
      among other hearing disorders, which can affect their work more severely than a 
      hearing loss. This study investigated the use of hearing protectors, the 
      prevalence of self-reported hearing disorders among musicians, and the importance 
      of these hearing disorders to the musicians. The musicians at three Danish 
      symphony orchestras were asked to complete a questionnaire on the topic. Results 
      showed that Danish musicians are aware of the dangers of loud music, yet they 
      rarely use hearing protectors and not always correctly; however, musicians with 
      hearing disorders use hearing protectors more frequently. In addition, the 
      musicians questioned suffered from different hearing disorders. Education is 
      needed to change musicians' opinion of hearing conservation and hearing 
      protectors. The education must be directed to both the musicians and the 
      administration of the symphony orchestras.

AB  - Orchestral musicians-an at-risk group for noise-induced hearing loss-have 
      consistently reported great difficulty using hearing protection while performing 
      or rehearsing, even when using earplugs specifically designed for musicians. A 
      recent innovation in this field has been electronic earplugs that claim to 
      deliver very high quality sound and only attenuate when sound levels become 
      excessive. This study investigated these claims, aiming to determine whether 
      professional orchestral musicians were able to use these devices and whether they 
      were preferred to existing earplugs. Initially clinical and laboratory testing 
      was carried out on the devices, indicating some spectral alteration of processed 
      sound occurred, however claims of attenuation properties were validated. 
      Following this, 26 orchestral musicians used the devices during rehearsals and 
      performances for at least four weeks, providing feedback throughout this period. 
      While musicians preferred the devices to previous earplugs, they identified 
      issues including difficulty with orchestral balance, perception of dynamics and 
      quality of sound provided by the devices. Results indicate these earplugs are a 
      very positive step towards a usable hearing conservation tool for orchestral 
      musicians to use in conjunction with other risk mitigation measures.

TI  - Hearing assessment of classical orchestral musicians.
PG  - 13-23
AB  - Pure-tone audiometry was performed on 140 classical orchestral musicians employed 
      at the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra and the Gothenburg Opera in Sweden. This 
      report is based on the results from hearing threshold measurements, presented as 
      median audiograms according to gender, age group and instrument group. The 
      results did not show severe hearing losses that could be attributed to exposure 
      to musical noise. However, the study reflects the subjects' present hearing 
      ability status and does not give an answer to the question of future hearing 
      dysfunction. Female musicians were shown to have significantly better hearing 
      thresholds in the high-frequency area than did male musicians. Furthermore, the 
      median pure-tone hearing thresholds for the male musicians displayed a notch 
      configuration at 6 kHz in the left ear, similar that of to noise-induced hearing 
      loss. A small, but in general not significant, difference was detected when 
      comparing the median hearing thresholds between each instrument group. Percussion 
      and woodwind players displayed slightly worse hearing thresholds than did other 
      musicians. Players of large string instruments had the best hearing threshold 
      values. When comparing age groups and gender it was noted that the median hearing 
      thresholds were stable and within 20 dB HL up to the age group of 40-49 years for 
      both females and males.

TI  - A Preliminary Analysis of Noise Exposure and Medical Outcomes for Department of 
      Defense Military Musicians.
PG  - 76-82
AB  - Noise exposure is a known occupational health hazard to those serving in the 
      military. Previous military epidemiology studies have identified military 
      occupations at risk of noise induced hearing loss (NIHL); however, musicians have 
      not been specifically mentioned. The focus of military NIHL studies is usually on 
      those service members of the combat arms occupations. This project was a 
      preliminary examination of Department of Defense (DoD) active duty military 
      musicians in regard to their noise exposure, annual hearing test rates, and 
      hearing injury rates using available data sources. The analysis concluded that 
      DoD military musicians are an underserved population in terms of hearing 
      conservation efforts. Noise surveillance data extracted from the Defense 
      Occupational and Environmental Health Readiness System-Industrial Hygiene showed 
      that every musician similar exposure group (SEG) with noise survey data from 2009 
      to 2013 exceeded the occupation exposure level adopted by DoD Instruction 
      6055.12. However, only a small percentage of all DoD active duty military 
      musicians (5.5% in the peak year of 2012) were assigned to a SEG that was 
      actually surveyed. Hearing test data based on Current Procedural Terminology 
      coding extracted from the Military Health System revealed that the percentage of 
      musicians with annual hearing tests increased over the 5 years studied in all 
      services except the Air Force. During 2013, the data showed that the Navy had the 
      highest percentage of musicians with annual hearing tests at 70.9%, and the Air 
      Force had the lowest at 11.4%. The Air Force had the highest percentage of 
      hearing injuries of those musicians with annual hearing tests for all 5 years 
      analyzed. Although noise surveillance and annual hearing tests are being 
      conducted, they occur at a much lower rate than required for a population that is 
      known to be overexposed to noise.

TI  - Functional hearing loss presenting as sudden hearing loss: a case report.
PG  - 407-10
AB  - A case of functional hearing loss presenting as sudden sensorineural hearing loss 
      in the only hearing ear of a musician is presented. Pure-tone audiometric 
      evaluation showed good intratest and intertest consistency. The pitfalls of 
      diagnosis, ultimately made by brain stem evoked response audiometry, are 
      discussed in light of the literature on sudden and functional hearing loss. 
      Psychiatric evaluation revealed features consistent with hysterical conversion. 
      It is argued that it is important to establish the exact etiologic agent of 
      functional hearing loss despite the difficulty of diagnosis so that the patient 
      may receive appropriate treatment.

TI  - Vestibular findings in military band musicians.
PG  - 122-7
LID - 10.1055/s-0034-1368140 [doi]
AB  - Introduction Exposure to music is the subject of many studies because it is 
      related to an individual's professional and social activities. 
      Objectives Evaluate the vestibular behavior in military band musicians. Methods A 
      retrospective cross-sectional study was performed. Nineteen musicians with ages 
      ranging from 21 to 46 years were evaluated (average = 33.7 years and standard 
      deviation = 7.2 years). They underwent anamnesis and vestibular and 
      otolaryngologic evaluation through vectoelectronystagmography. Results The most 
      evident otoneurologic symptoms in the anamnesis were tinnitus (84.2%), hearing 
      difficulties (47.3%), dizziness (36.8%), headache (26.3%), intolerance to intense 
      sounds (21.0%), and earache (15.7%). Seven musicians (37.0%) showed vestibular 
      abnormality, which occurred in the caloric test. The abnormality was more 
      prevalent in the peripheral vestibular system, and there was a predominance of 
      irritative peripheral vestibular disorders. Conclusion The alteration in 
      vestibular exam occurred in the caloric test (37.0%). There were changes in the 
      prevalence of peripheral vestibular system with a predominance of irritative 
      vestibular dysfunction. Dizziness was the most significant symptom for the 
      vestibular test in correlation with neurotologic symptoms. The present study made 
      it possible to verify the importance of the labyrinthine test, which demonstrates 
      that this population should be better studied because the systematic exposure to 
      high sound pressure levels may cause major vestibular alterations.

TI  - In Their Own Words: Interviews with Musicians Reveal the Advantages and 
      Disadvantages of Wearing Earplugs.
PG  - 101-110
LID - 10.21091/mppa.2017.2017 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Musicians are at risk of hearing loss from sound exposure, and 
      earplugs form part of many musicians' hearing conservation practices. Although 
      musicians typically report a range of difficulties when wearing earplugs, there 
      are many who have managed to successfully incorporate earplugs into their 
      practice of music. OBJECTIVE: The study aim was to provide a detailed account of 
      earplug usage from the perspective of the musician, including motivating factors, 
      practical strategies, and attitudes. METHODS: In-depth interviews with 23 
      musicians were transcribed and content analysis was performed. Responses were 
      coded and classified into three main themes: advantages, disadvantages, and usage 
      patterns and strategies, together with an overlapping fourth theme, youth 
      perspectives. RESULTS: Several positive aspects of wearing earplugs were 
      identified, including long-term hearing protection and reduced levels of fatigue 
      and pain. Musicians reported that earplugs present few problems for 
      communication, improve sound clarity in ensembles, are discreet, and are easy to 
      handle. However, earplugs also present challenges, including an overall dullness 
      of sound, reduced immediacy, and an impaired ability to judge balance and 
      intonation due to the occlusion effect, all of which influence usage habits and 
      patterns. CONCLUSION: The experiences of the younger musicians and long-term 
      users of earplugs indicate that practice, persistence, and a flexible approach 
      are required for successful earplug usage. In time, there may be greater 
      acceptance of earplugs, particularly amongst a new generation of musicians, some 
      of whom regard the earplugs as a performance enhancement tool as well as a 
      protective device.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study investigated clinical care delivered to musicians in 
      Australia by audiologists and manufacturers of musicians' hearing protectors 
      (MHP). DESIGN: Audiologists with experience treating musicians were invited to 
      complete a survey on their service delivery. A second survey was administered to 
      manufacturers of MHPs. STUDY SAMPLE: Four manufacturers of MHP and 31 
      audiologists completed the surveys. Post hoc analyses were performed comparing 
      the responses of audiologists with more versus less clinical experience; and 
      those with and without musical training. RESULTS: There was considerable 
      variation in the audiological care provided to musicians. Only one-third of 
      audiologists performed pure-tone audiometry prior to MHP fitting, and there was 
      little consistency across the sample in relation to impression taking, preferred 
      attenuation or selection of canal length. There was also significant variation in 
      the manufacturers' approach to MHP, each of whom provided different 
      recommendations regarding preferred impression techniques and material viscosity. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study reveal lack of consistency across the 
      hearing healthcare sector with respect to care of musicians' hearing, with 
      potential to impact upon the satisfaction with, and usage of, MHP. There is need 
      for evidence-based, best practice guidelines and training to support clinical 
      audiologists in providing optimal care.

LID - 10.3109/14992020903470809 [doi]
AB  - This study describes the prevalence and characteristics of noise-induced hearing 
      loss (NIHL) in student musicians (N = 329) aged 18-25 years. Students completed a 
      questionnaire regarding exposures before a hearing assessment. NIHL was defined 
      by the presence of a notch 15 dB in depth at 4000 or 6000 Hz relative to the best 
      preceding threshold. Overall prevalence of NIHL was 45%, with 78% of notches 
      occurring at 6000 Hz. The proportion of the total population with bilateral 
      notching at any frequency was 11.5%, mostly occurring at 6000 Hz. There was a 
      significant increase in the frequency of notching in students who reported more 
      than two hours per day of personal practice. There were no significant 
      associations for instrument group or other noise exposures. The data suggest that 
      susceptibility to NIHL among students of music is not uniform and cannot be 
      ascribed solely to the instrument played and other exposures. Students with 
      bilateral losses tend to have deeper notches and may represent a group that has 
      an inherent predisposition to NIHL.

TI  - [Occupational diseases of musicians: the price of perfection].
PG  - 11-17
LID - 10.12961/aprl.2018.21.1.03 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Musicians suffer from a wide range of health problems related to 
      their profession. The aim of this paper was to assess whether work-related 
      musician diseases are included into the Official Spanish List of Occupational 
      Diseases and, if so, to describe and quantify those recognized in recent years. 
      METHODS: The Official Spanish List of Occupational Diseases was searched to 
      identify occupational diseases affecting musicians. We then conducted an 
      incidence study of those occupational diseases recognized under code 29.32 
      Composers, musicians and singers (CNO-2011) for the period 2007 to 2014. Cases 
      and rates were described and represented by disease type, gender and year of 
      recognition. RESULTS: Ten entries were identified as musician diseases in the 
      official occupational disease list; mostly involved musculoskeletal disorders 
      (MSD) and hearing loss. Mental health disorders and focal dystonia are not 
      included in the list. In the period 2007-2014, 213 cases were identified, 120 for 
      men and 93 for women. Of these, 81% were MSD, 11% hearing loss and 7% vocal cord 
      nodules. The average incidence rate per 100,000 was 18.3 (19.1 in men and 17.3 in 
      women). CONCLUSIONS: The official Spanish List of Occupational Diseases allows 
      the recognition of most occupational diseases affecting musicians with the 
      exception of focal dystonia and mental health disorders. Their inclusion should 
      be evaluated. The highest incidence corresponds to musculoskeletal disorders.

TI  - Is the audiologic status of professional musicians a reflection of the noise 
      exposure in classical orchestral music?
PG  - 753-8
AB  - The sound in classical orchestral music is louder than noise emissions allowed by 
      national rules in industry. We wanted to assess the audiologic status of 
      professional musicians at different ages of their careers and to look for a 
      coherence of declined hearing ability and the sound emissions in order to 
      substantiate advices for hearing protection and occupational medicine in 
      musicians. Data from questionnaires (anamnestic data on sound exposure in 
      profession and leisure times, use of hearing protection, self-evaluation of 
      hearing function and hearing deficits), audiometric data and amplitudes of OAE 
      were evaluated from 109 professional musicians aged 30-69 years from three major 
      German orchestras and from 110 students of an academy of music (aged 11-19 
      years). Sound emissions of the whole orchestra and of single 
      instruments/instrument groups were measured at the orchestra stages and pits 
      during rehearsals and performances. None of the musicians was engaged in noisy 
      hobbies and only a few used hearing protectors regularly. More than 50% of the 
      musicians had a hearing loss of 15 dB(A) and more. Highest losses were found 
      among the strings and the brass players. DPOAE amplitudes coincidently declined 
      with the duration of performing music in the orchestras. Professional musicians 
      aged older than 60 years had a significantly greater hearing loss at 4 and 6 kHz 
      than those aged 30-39 years. Among the strings in one orchestra a dominant 
      hearing deficit in the left ears was observed. Musicians need the same health 
      care for their hearing as workers in noisy industry. A better education on the 
      hearing hazards (use of hearing protectors) as well as sound protection in the 
      rehearsal rooms is necessary. Hearing loss in professional musicians should be 
      accepted as an occupational disease.

TI  - Factors affecting the use of hearing protectors among classical music players.
PG  - 21-9
AB  - Classical musicians are often exposed to sound levels that exceed the Finnish 
      national action limit value of 85 dB(A). Still, the use of hearing protectors is 
      uncommon among musicians. The purpose of this study was to find out musician's 
      attitudes towards hearing protectors, and under which conditions hearing 
      protectors are used. The study group consisted of five major classical orchestras 
      in the Helsinki region. The players were asked to fill out a questionnaire with 
      questions on hearing protection, ear symptoms, including tinnitus, hearing loss, 
      pain in the ears, and temporary ringing in the ears. Also, questions concerning 
      stress and working environments were asked. Of those who responded, 94% were 
      concerned about their hearing to some degree. Only 6% of the musicians always 
      used hearing protector devices (HPDs). Self-reported hearing loss was quite 
      common, with 31% of the musicians reporting some hearing loss. Temporary tinnitus 
      was even more common at 37%. There were 15% of women, and 18% of men reporting 
      permanent tinnitus. Hyper-acousis was reported by 43% of the musicians. The ear 
      symptoms affected the usage rate. Hearing protectors were used more often among 
      musicians having ear symptoms (20%) than those reporting no symptoms (6%). 
      Further, the 43% of the musicians found their work to be interesting and 
      meaningful. Stress was experienced to some extent by 60%, and musicians with ear 
      symptoms had three to nine times more stress and felt their working environment 
      noisier. The study shows that musicians seldom use hearing protectors before 
      symptoms begin. Symptoms increased usage rate, but the usage levels are still far 
      from ideal. Motivation and training is needed to improve hearing protector use 
      among musicians.

TI  - Effects of instrument type and orchestral position on hearing sensitivity for 
      0.25 to 20 kHz in the orchestral musician.
PG  - 215-21
AB  - Minnesota Orchestra members (42 males, 18 females) aged 24 to 64 years, all 
      asymptomatic for hearing problems or ear disease, were evaluated with a hearing 
      history questionnaire, otolaryngologic examination, and pure tone audiometry for 
      the conventional (0.25 to 8 kHz) and extended high frequency (9 to 20 kHz) 
      ranges. Hearing sensitivity was examined with respect to musician instrument 
      type, years of playing, and orchestral stage position. Type of instrument played 
      and position on the orchestral stage had no significant correlation with hearing 
      loss.

TI  - Evaluation of the noise exposure of symphonic orchestra musicians.
PG  - 40-6
LID - 10.4103/1463-1741.127854 [doi]
AB  - For musicians, the impact of noise exposure is not yet fully characterized. Some 
      inconsistencies can be found in the methodology used to evaluate noise exposure. 
      This study aims to analyze the noise exposure of musicians in a symphonic 
      orchestra to understand their risk for hearing loss, applying the methodology 
      proposed by ISO 9612:2009. Noise levels were monitored among musicians during the 
      rehearsal of eight different repertoires. Test subjects were selected according 
      to their instrument and position in the orchestra. Participants wore noise 
      dosimeters throughout the rehearsals. A sound meter was used to analyze the 
      exposure of the conductor. The results showed that musicians are exposed to high 
      noise levels that can damage hearing. Brass, woodwind and percussion and timpani 
      musicians were exposed to noise levels in excess of the upper exposure action 
      level of 85 dB (A), while the other instrumental groups had a lower exposure 
      action level of 80 dB (A). Percussion musicians were exposed to high peak noise 
      levels of 135 dB (C). Sound levels varied by instrument, repertoire and position. 
      Octave frequency analyses showed differences among musicians. This study suggests 
      that musicians are at risk for hearing loss. There is a need for more effective 
      guidelines applicable to all countries, which should define standardized 
      procedures for determining musician noise exposure and should allow exposure 
      level normalization to the year, including different repertoires.

TI  - University student musician noise-dosage study measuring both ensemble and 
      full-day noise exposure.
PG  - EL494
LID - 10.1121/1.5110238 [doi]
AB  - A risk factor shared by all musicians is a potential for noise-induced hearing 
      loss. A study was conducted to explore what factors determine noise dosage during 
      musical events experienced by college student musicians. First, noise exposure 
      during specific activities was explored, including during ensemble rehearsal and 
      personal practice. Next, full-day noise exposure was investigated by measuring 
      levels experienced by student musicians during a typical daily routine. Factors 
      such as instrument played, type of activity, location within ensemble, and room 
      environment were related to noise dosage. Disparities in results using different 
      standards to calculate noise dosage were also explored. Risk of noise 
      overexposure was found to be greater in some instrument classes, such as wind 
      instruments, than in others, such as string instruments, and can yield vastly 
      different results depending on the metric used for noise dosage calculation.

LID - e92454
AB  - Modern cochlear implant (CI) users understand speech but find difficulty in music 
      appreciation due to poor pitch perception. Still, some deaf musicians continue to 
      perform with their CI. Here we show unexpected results that CI musicians can 
      reliably tune a guitar by CI alone and, under controlled conditions, match 
      simultaneously presented tones to <0.5 Hz. One subject had normal contralateral 
      hearing and produced more accurate tuning with CI than his normal ear. To 
      understand these counterintuitive findings, we presented tones sequentially and 
      found that tuning error was larger at ∼ 30 Hz for both subjects. A third subject, 
      a non-musician CI user with normal contralateral hearing, showed similar trends 
      in performance between CI and normal hearing ears but with less precision. This 
      difference, along with electric analysis, showed that accurate tuning was 
      achieved by listening to beats rather than discriminating pitch, effectively 
      turning a spectral task into a temporal discrimination task.

TI  - [Acoustic trauma in classical music players].
PG  - 401-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To confirm the existence of acoustic trauma in classical musicians. 
      MATERIAL AND METHOD: Sixty-five volunteers from the Castilla and León Symphony 
      Orchestra were studied. The hearing thresholds of each musician were 
      age-corrected using the ELI and ISO 7029:2000 scales. Furthermore the sound 
      levels of the instruments in this symphony orchestra were studied. RESULTS: We 
      observed that the sound level of the symphony orchestra instruments is higher 
      than the level permitted by law, ie it constitutes a risk for hearing loss. We 
      also found that 4 kHz hearing loss in the 5th percentile among musicians was 
      double the rate that would be expected for age, and that violinists and viola 
      players showed poorer hearing in the left ear. CONCLUSIONS: Classical music 
      causes acoustic trauma in musicians and should be recognized as a professional 
      illness. Musicians are obliged to protect their hearing and to undergo regular 
      check-ups.

TI  - The comprehensive audiological evaluation in young violinists: the medial 
      olivocochlear system, high frequency thresholds, and the auditory figure ground 
      test.
PG  - 3837-3845
LID - 10.1007/s00405-021-07122-8 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to examine whether the medial olivocochlear 
      hearing system functions, the high frequency hearing thresholds and speech 
      discrimination in noise performance can guide us in assessing the risk of hearing 
      loss among violinists. It is aimed to investigate possible hearing damage that is 
      not reflected in pure tone hearing thresholds in violinists. METHODS: The 
      participants (n = 50) who have normal hearing and the ages of 18-30 were included 
      in this study in two groups: violinists and controls who are unrelated to music. 
      High frequency audiometer, auditory figure ground test (AFG) for speech 
      discrimination in noise performance, Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emission 
      (DPOAE) and contralateral suppression on DPOAE for medial olivocochlear system 
      function tests were applied to all participants as well as routine audiological 
      tests. RESULTS: The high frequency hearing thresholds were obtained higher in 
      violinists compared to the controls. In violinists, the AFG test scores and the 
      suppression amount at 1 kHz were lower than the controls. In addition, DPOAE 
      responses at 4-6 kHz were obtained lower in violinists (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: 
      The reason for high frequency hearing loss, decreased DPOAE response amplitudes, 
      and poor medial olivocochlear function in violinists can be explained by the 
      long-term exposure to high-level noise caused by the violin, one of the closest 
      musical instruments. Routine and comprehensive audiological follow-up is crucial 
      for musicians.

TI  - Hearing in pop musicians.
PG  - 225-31
AB  - Comparatively few previous studies have investigated the hearing of pop 
      musicians. On the average, a surprisingly low percentage (5%) of hearing loss was 
      demonstrated in 160 pop musicians. The present material comprises 83 musicians, 
      with an average exposure of 9 years. Group mean hearing thresholds show only a 
      slight deviation from normal. Age, weekly and total exposure time appear to 
      increase the risk of hearing impairment. In the individual analysis 13-30% were 
      found to have a sensorineural hearing loss, depending upon the definition of 
      hearing loss. Subjects with hearing loss show a discrete impairment in the 
      frequency range 3-8 kHz. Considering the sound levels and the length of exposure, 
      the incidence of hearing loss is suprisingly low. Possible reasons for this are 
      discussed.

AB  - It is well known that hearing abilities decline with age, and one of the most 
      commonly reported hearing difficulties reported in older adults is a reduced 
      ability to understand speech in noisy environments. Older adult musicians have an 
      enhanced ability to understand speech in noise, and this has been associated with 
      enhanced brain responses related to both speech processing and the deployment of 
      attention; however, the causal impact of music lessons in older adults has not 
      yet been demonstrated. To investigate whether a causal relationship exists 
      between short-term musical training and performance on auditory tests in older 
      adults and to determine if musical training can be used to improve hearing in 
      older adult nonmusicians, we conducted a longitudinal training study with random 
      assignment. A sample of older adults was randomly assigned to learn to play piano 
      (Music), to learn to play a visuospatially demanding video game (Video), or to 
      serve as a no-contact control (No-contact). After 6 months, the Music group 
      improved their ability to understand a word presented in loud background noise, 
      whereas the other 2 groups did not. This improvement was related to an increase 
      in positive-going electrical brain activity at fronto-left electrodes 200-1000 ms 
      after the presentation of a word in noise. Source analyses suggest that this 
      activity was due to sources located in the left inferior frontal gyrus and other 
      regions involved in the speech-motor system. These findings support the idea that 
      musical training provides a causal benefit to hearing abilities. Importantly, 
      these findings suggest that musical training could be used as a foundation to 
      develop auditory rehabilitation programs for older adults.

LID - 10.4103/1463-1741.74002 [doi]
AB  - With over 70 dancers and its own orchestra, The National Ballet of Canada ranks 
      amongst the world's top dance companies. It performs three seasons annually: 
      fall, winter and summer, plus many shows of Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker. The 
      70-strong orchestra plays an average of 360 hours/year including rehearsals and 
      performances. Rehearsals are held at two locations: one in a ballet rehearsal 
      room with little or no absorption, and the other in an acoustically treated 
      location. Performances are held in the Four Seasons Centre for the Performing 
      Arts in Toronto. The present survey was done at the request of the National 
      Ballet, since the musicians complained of excessive sound levels and were 
      concerned about possible hearing losses. The survey was performed using five 
      dosimeters Quest Mod 300 during 10 performances of the ballet Romeo and Juliet by 
      Sergei Prokofiev, deemed as the noisiest in the whole repertoire. Results of the 
      survey indicate that the noise exposure levels from only the orchestra's 
      activities do not present risk of hearing loss. Exposure due to other musical 
      activities was, however, not included.

TI  - Neural Encoding of Speech and Music: Implications for Hearing Speech in Noise.
PG  - 129-141
AB  - Understanding speech in a background of competing noise is challenging, 
      especially for individuals with hearing loss or deficits in auditory processing 
      ability. The ability to hear in background noise cannot be predicted from the 
      audiogram, an assessment of peripheral hearing ability; therefore, it is 
      important to consider the impact of central and cognitive factors on 
      speech-in-noise perception. Auditory processing in complex environments is 
      reflected in neural encoding of pitch, timing, and timbre, the crucial elements 
      of speech and music. Musical expertise in processing pitch, timing, and timbre 
      may transfer to enhancements in speech-in-noise perception due to shared neural 
      pathways for speech and music. Through cognitive-sensory interactions, musicians 
      develop skills enabling them to selectively listen to relevant signals embedded 
      in a network of melodies and harmonies, and this experience leads in turn to 
      enhanced ability to focus on one voice in a background of other voices. Here we 
      review recent work examining the biological mechanisms of speech and music 
      perception and the potential for musical experience to ameliorate speech-in-noise 
      listening difficulties.

TI  - Effect of the Finnish Tube on the Voice of a Deaf Musician: A Case Report.

AB  - PURPOSE: To verify the auditory-perceptual and acoustic effects of the 
      semioccluded vocal tract exercise with Finnish tube on the vocal quality of a 
      deaf musician. METHODS: A seven-day protocol with Finnish tube was performed with 
      guidance for its home replication twice a day. A 46-years-old man with profound 
      bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, musician and composer participated. Before 
      and after the application of the protocol had undergone tonal audiometry, 
      nasofibrolaryngoscopy, acoustic analysis with Praat and auditory-perceptual 
      evaluation of the voice with Voice Profile Analysis Scheme for Brazilian 
      Portuguese. RESULTS: The postintervention auditory-perceptual analysis identified 
      reduction of the deviation in lip spreading, extensive labial range, raised 
      tongue body, pharyngeal expansion, nasal resonance, larynx height, larynx and 
      vocal tract tension and irregularity, pitch, speech rate, and a better 
      respiratory support. The maximum phonation time reduced, probably because of 
      elimination of the abrupt vocal attack and tension, articulatory deviations, 
      improvement in voicing and the absence of the use of expiratory reserve air. The 
      fundamental frequency became lower, and the first, second, third, and fourth 
      formants became higher. The jitter increased, and the shimmer reduced. 
      CONCLUSION: The use of the Finnish tube might have facilitated the voicing 
      sensations in the deaf musician, by enhancing the tactile-kinesthetic perception 
      of the vocal tract and brought a greater source-filter interaction.

TI  - Pop-rock musicians: assessment of their satisfaction provided by hearing 
      protectors.
PG  - 454-61
AB  - Pop-rock musicians are at risk of developing hearing loss and other symptoms 
      related to amplified music. AIM: The aim of the present study was to assess the 
      satisfaction provided by the use of hearing protection in pop-rock musicians. 
      STUDY DESIGN: Contemporary cohort study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A study of 23 
      male pop-rock musicians, aged between 25 to 45 years. After audiological 
      evaluation (pure tone audiometry, middle ear analysis, TEOAE and DPOAE) hearing 
      protective devices were provided to be used for three months. After that 
      musicians answered a satisfaction assessment questionnaire. RESULTS: The 
      prevalence of hearing loss was of 21.7%. The most common complaints about the 
      hearing protectors were: autophonia, pressure in the ears, interference in high 
      frequencies perception and full time use of the hearing protector during 
      concerts. There was a positive correlation between a reduction in tinnitus after 
      the use of the HPD with the following complaints: tinnitus after beginning the 
      career (p= 0.044), discomfort with the sound intensity in the work place (p= 
      0.009) and intolerance to loud sound (p= 0.029). CONCLUSIONS: There was a high 
      prevalence of hearing loss and a positive tendency towards the use of the ear 
      protector device among the sample population.

TI  - A Role of Medial Olivocochlear Reflex as a Protection Mechanism from 
      Noise-Induced Hearing Loss Revealed in Short-Practicing Violinists.
PG  - e0146751
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0146751 [doi]
LID - e0146751
AB  - Previous studies have indicated that extended exposure to a high level of sound 
      might increase the risk of hearing loss among professional symphony orchestra 
      musicians. One of the major problems associated with musicians' hearing loss is 
      difficulty in estimating its risk simply on the basis of the physical amount of 
      exposure, i.e. the exposure level and duration. The aim of this study was to 
      examine whether the measurement of the medial olivocochlear reflex (MOCR), which 
      is assumed to protect the cochlear from acoustic damage, could enable us to 
      assess the risk of hearing loss among musicians. To test this, we compared the 
      MOCR strength and the hearing deterioration caused by one-hour instrument 
      practice. The participants in the study were music university students who are 
      majoring in the violin, whose left ear is exposed to intense violin sounds 
      (broadband sounds containing a significant number of high-frequency components) 
      during their regular instrument practice. Audiogram and click-evoked otoacoustic 
      emissions (CEOAEs) were measured before and after a one-hour violin practice. 
      There was a larger exposure to the left ear than to the right ear, and we 
      observed a left-ear specific temporary threshold shift (TTS) after the violin 
      practice. Left-ear CEOAEs decreased proportionally to the TTS. The exposure 
      level, however, could not entirely explain the inter-individual variation in the 
      TTS and the decrease in CEOAE. On the other hand, the MOCR strength could predict 
      the size of the TTS and CEOAE decrease. Our findings imply that, among other 
      factors, the MOCR is a promising measure for assessing the risk of hearing loss 
      among musicians.

TI  - Hearing loss prevention education using adopt-a-band: changes in self-reported 
      earplug use in two high school marching bands.
PG  - 211-26
LID - 10.1044/2014_AJA-14-0001 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Hearing loss prevention has always been an important issue for 
      audiologists. The importance of hearing loss prevention education for young 
      musicians is now recognized by the National Association for Music Education as 
      well as the National Association of Schools of Music. Adopt-a-Band is a 
      commercial program designed to foster hearing loss prevention behavior in young 
      musicians. METHOD: This study assessed changes in earplug use, measured using 
      self-report surveys, after Adopt-a-Band training. Participants were members of 2 
      high school marching bands who viewed an informational DVD and reviewed fact 
      sheets. Flat-attenuation earplugs were distributed, and training was provided. In 
      addition, study participants engaged in discussion of hearing loss with a doctor 
      of audiology student. RESULTS: Before training, 23% of participants reported they 
      had previously used hearing protection. Immediately after training, 94% of 
      participants reported they planned to use hearing protection at least 
      occasionally. In a final end-of-season survey, earplug use had reliably 
      increased; 62% of participants reported they used earplugs at least occasionally. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Earplug use increased, but self-reported behavioral change was not 
      as robust as predicted from self-reported participant intentions. Participant 
      comments regarding factors that influenced their earplug use decisions suggest 
      opportunities to improve training.

TI  - Music to Our Ears: Are Dancers at Risk for High Sound Level Exposure?
PG  - 227-232
LID - 10.21091/mppa.2020.4033 [doi]
AB  - Enduring exposure to high sound pressure levels (SPLs) can lead to noise-induced 
      hearing loss (NIHL). In the performing arts population, NIHL has been studied 
      primarily in the context of sound exposure experienced by musicians and less so 
      by dancers. This research aimed to identify sound exposure that dancers may 
      experience in some dance classes. Decibel levels were recorded in 12 dance 
      classes (6 ballet, 4 modern, and 1 soft and 1 hard shoe Irish dance) at 8 
      different studios using the NIOSH SLM app on an iOS smartphone with external 
      microphone. A minimum of five recordings of each class was measured, each 
      collected on a different day, yielding a total of 114 measurements. Results 
      showed that 20.2% of all recordings exceeded the recommended NIOSH sound exposure 
      limits of both 100% projected daily dose and 85 LAeq. Analysis between styles of 
      dance demonstrated significantly lower LAeq (p≤0.05) in soft shoe Irish dance 
      compared to ballet (p=0.023), modern (p=0.035), and Irish hard shoe dance 
      (p=0.009). Irish soft shoe dance demonstrated minimal to no risk of high sound 
      exposure. Conversely, 53.25% of ballet, 90.9% of Irish hard shoe dance, and 
      68.24% of modern recordings exhibited minimal to moderate risk of high sound 
      exposure. Furthermore, we found wide ranges of projected daily noise doses within 
      classes taught by the same teacher. It is recommended that multiple recordings of 
      dance environments be obtained, as a single sound recording may not accurately 
      represent potential exposure. These findings indicate that dancers of Irish hard 
      shoe, modern, and ballet may benefit from noise intervention such as audiometric 
      testing, noise controls, and hearing protection.

AB  - Musicians from a wide range of backgrounds experience playing-related health 
      problems including musculoskeletal disorders, hearing loss, and performance 
      anxiety. Few studies have focused specifically on the health concerns of 
      musicians in Malaysia. AIMS: This study aimed to investigate playing-related 
      health problems among student musicians at a university in Malaysia as well as 
      their knowledge and awareness of playing-related health problems. METHODS: 
      Instrumental music students enrolled in undergraduate and post-graduate 
      university music courses (n=98) participated in a self-report online survey which 
      addressed aspects such as educational background, playing experience, knowledge 
      and awareness of musicians' health issues, history of physical problems, 
      lifestyle factors, and prevention and management strategies. RESULTS: Of the 
      total participants, 28.9% reported that they were currently experiencing 
      playing-related pain in a body part, and 46.4% had experienced playing-related 
      pain at some time. More than half (56.7%) felt that they have not received enough 
      information or advice on playing-related health during their current studies. 
      Musicians who experienced playing-related pain, tension, and discomfort reported 
      the main problem sites to be the fingers and hands, arms, neck, and shoulders. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The study results demonstrate that Malaysian university music 
      students are affected by similar types of playing-related physical problems as 
      their counterparts around the world. A greater awareness and knowledge of injury 
      prevention and management strategies is needed so that these music students can 
      sustain healthy playing careers.

AB  - Perceiving speech in noise (SIN) is important for health and well-being and 
      decreases with age. Musicians show improved speech-in-noise abilities and reduced 
      age-related auditory decline, yet it is unclear whether short term music 
      engagement has similar effects. In this randomized control trial we used a 
      pre-post design to investigate whether a 12-week music intervention in adults 
      aged 50-65 without prior music training and with subjective hearing loss improves 
      well-being, speech-in-noise abilities, and auditory encoding and voluntary 
      attention as indexed by auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) in a syllable-in-noise 
      task, and later AEPs in an oddball task. Age and gender-matched adults were 
      randomized to a choir or control group. Choir participants sang in a 2-hr 
      ensemble with 1-hr home vocal training weekly; controls listened to a 3-hr 
      playlist weekly, attended concerts, and socialized online with fellow 
      participants. From pre- to post-intervention, no differences between groups were 
      observed on quantitative measures of well-being or behavioral speech-in-noise 
      abilities. In the choir group, but not the control group, changes in the N1 
      component were observed for the syllable-in-noise task, with increased N1 
      amplitude in the passive condition and decreased N1 latency in the active 
      condition. During the oddball task, larger N1 amplitudes to the frequent standard 
      stimuli were also observed in the choir but not control group from pre to post 
      intervention. Findings have implications for the potential role of music training 
      to improve sound encoding in individuals who are in the vulnerable age range and 
      at risk of auditory decline.

TI  - Association Analysis of Candidate Gene Polymorphisms and Tinnitus in Young 
      Musicians.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Subjective tinnitus, a perception of phantom sound, is a common 
      otological condition that affects almost 15% of the general population. It is 
      known that noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) and tinnitus exhibit a high level of 
      comorbidity in individuals exposed to intense noise and music. However, the 
      influence of genetic variants associated with NIHL on tinnitus remains elusive. 
      We hypothesized that young musicians carrying genetic variants associated with 
      NIHL would exhibit a higher prevalence of tinnitus than their counterparts. 
      METHODS: To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the database by Bhatt et al. (2020) 
      (originally developed by Phillips et al., 2015) that investigated the genetic 
      links to NIHL in young college-aged musicians. The present study identified 186 
      participants (average age = 20.3 yrs, range = 18-25 yrs) with normal tympanometry 
      and otoscopic findings and with no missing data. We included 19 single nucleotide 
      polymorphisms in 13 cochlear genes that were previously associated with NIHL. The 
      candidate genes include: KCNE1, KCNQ1, CDH23, GJB2, GJB4, KCNJ10, CAT, HSP70, 
      PCDH70, MYH14, GRM7, PON2, and ESRRB. RESULTS: We find that individuals with at 
      least one minor allele of rs163171 (C > T) in KCNQ1 exhibit significantly higher 
      odds of reporting tinnitus compared to individuals carrying the major allele of 
      rs163171. KCNE1 rs2070358 revealed a suggestive association (p = 0.049) with 
      tinnitus, but the FDR corrected p-value did not achieve statistical significance 
      (p < 0.05). A history of ear infection and sound level tolerance showed a 
      statistically significant association with tinnitus. Music exposure showed a 
      suggestive association trend with tinnitus. Biological sex revealed a 
      statistically significant association with distortion product otoacoustic 
      emissions SNR measures. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that KCNQ1/KCNE1 voltage-gated 
      potassium ion channel plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of NIHL and 
      tinnitus. Further research is required to construct clinical tools for 
      identifying genetically predisposed individuals well before they acquire NIHL and 
      tinnitus.

TI  - Does choir singing cause noise-induced hearing loss?
PG  - 38-51
AB  - Although health problems in musicians have been previously reported; not much is 
      known about noise-induced hearing loss due to choir singing. However, there are 
      data to show that peak levels of more than 110 dB SPL are produced in choir 
      singing, and major parts of sound energy can be found below 1 kHz and even 500 Hz 
      but not below 100 Hz. To find out about possible hearing loss due to professional 
      choir singing, we measured the hearing threshold level of 62 choir singers in a 
      large opera choir. Most publications about noise-induced hearing loss report that 
      the high-frequency region is impaired most. However, in our study the low 
      frequency region was affected most, when compared with normative data (especially 
      ISO 7029). Control groups of women and men with normal auditory function did not 
      show pure-tone hearing thresholds different from ISO 7029. The permanent 
      threshold shifts at 250 Hz and above are most likely noise induced with choir 
      singing as noise source. However, hearing losses at 125 Hz and possibly partial 
      at 250 Hz are caused by some other effect. An (unproven) hypothesis is that 
      singing might lead to increased endolymph pressure, and thus might cause hearing 
      loss especially in the low-frequency region. Whether more choirs show similar 
      hearing impairment and whether singing raises cerebrospinal fluid pressure will 
      be the subject of further investigations.

TI  - Extended high frequency hearing sensitivity. A normative threshold study in 
      musicians.
PG  - 196-202
AB  - Sixty members of the Minnesota Orchestra (aged 24 to 64 years) and 30 
      nonmusicians (aged 20 to 69 years) were evaluated for hearing sensitivity within 
      the conventional audiometric range (0.25 to 8 kHz) and within the extended high 
      frequency audiometric range (9 to 20 kHz). Threshold data were evaluated by age, 
      sex, and musician-nonmusician categories for the respective frequencies, and data 
      were compared to other studies. Musician hearing appeared no poorer than 
      nonmusician hearing, suggesting no major hearing loss from musicians exposure to 
      orchestral noise. Hearing acuity of the two groups was similar to some normal 
      groups reported in the world literature but appeared poorer in comparison to some 
      normal groups defined by a very restrictive definition of normal hearing. Issues 
      relating to the definition of normal hearing are explored. A mathematical model 
      descriptive of the extended high tone hearing sensitivity for musicians and 
      non-musicians evaluated was calculated. The formula is presented from which 
      typical age-specific extended high frequency thresholds may be calculated for the 
      90 subjects evaluated.

AB  - Musicians are at risk of hearing loss due to prolonged noise exposure, but they 
      may also be at risk of early sub-clinical hearing damage, such as cochlear 
      synaptopathy. In the current study, we investigated the effects of noise exposure 
      on electrophysiological, behavioral and self-report correlates of hearing damage 
      in young adult (age range = 18-27 years) musicians and non-musicians with normal 
      audiometric thresholds. Early-career musicians (n = 76) and non-musicians 
      (n = 47) completed a test battery including the Noise Exposure Structured 
      Interview, pure-tone audiometry (PTA; 0.25-8 kHz), extended high-frequency (EHF; 
      12 and 16 kHz) thresholds, otoacoustic emissions (OAEs), auditory brainstem 
      responses (ABRs), speech perception in noise (SPiN), and self-reported tinnitus, 
      hyperacusis and hearing in noise difficulties. Total lifetime noise exposure was 
      similar between musicians and non-musicians, the majority of which could be 
      accounted for by recreational activities. Musicians showed significantly greater 
      ABR wave I/V ratios than non-musicians and were also more likely to report 
      experience of - and/or more severe - tinnitus, hyperacusis and hearing in noise 
      difficulties, irrespective of noise exposure. A secondary analysis revealed that 
      individuals with the highest levels of noise exposure had reduced outer hair cell 
      function compared to individuals with the lowest levels of noise exposure, as 
      measured by OAEs. OAE level was also related to PTA and EHF thresholds. High 
      levels of noise exposure were also associated with a significant increase in ABR 
      wave V latency, but only for males, and a higher prevalence and severity of 
      hyperacusis. These findings suggest that there may be sub-clinical effects of 
      noise exposure on various hearing metrics even at a relatively young age, but do 
      not support a link between lifetime noise exposure and proxy measures of cochlear 
      synaptopathy such as ABR wave amplitudes and SPiN. Closely monitoring OAEs, PTA 
      and EHF thresholds when conventional PTA is within the clinically 'normal' range 
      could provide a useful early metric of noise-induced hearing damage. This may be 
      particularly relevant to early-career musicians as they progress through a period 
      of intensive musical training, and thus interventions to protect hearing 
      longevity may be vital.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Many studies have examined the perception of musical emotion using 
      excerpts from familiar music that includes highly expressed emotions to classify 
      emotional choices. However, using familiar music to study musical emotions in 
      people with acquired hearing loss could produce ambiguous results as to whether 
      the emotional perception is due to previous experiences or listening to the 
      current musical stimuli. To overcome this limitation, we developed new musical 
      stimuli to study emotional perception without the effects of episodic memory. 
      METHODS: A musician was instructed to compose five melodies with evenly 
      distributed pitches around 1 kHz. The melodies were created to express the 
      emotions of happy, sad, angry, tender, and neutral. To evaluate whether these 
      melodies expressed the intended emotions, two methods were applied. First, we 
      classified the expressed emotions of melodies with selected musical features from 
      60 features using genetic algorithm-based k-nearest neighbors. Second, forty-four 
      people with normal hearing participated in an online survey regarding the 
      emotional perception of music based on dimensional and discrete approaches to 
      evaluate the musical stimuli set. RESULTS: Twenty-four selected musical features 
      produced classification for intended emotions with an accuracy of 76%. The 
      results of the online survey in the normal hearing (NH) group showed that the 
      intended emotions were selected significantly more often than the others. K-means 
      clustering analysis revealed that melodies with arousal and valence ratings 
      corresponded to representative quadrants of interest. Additionally, the 
      applicability of the stimuli was tested in 4 individuals with high-frequency 
      hearing loss. CONCLUSION: By applying the individuals with NH, the musical 
      stimuli were shown to classify emotions with high accuracy, as expressed. These 
      results confirm that the set of musical stimuli can be used to study the 
      perceived emotion in music, demonstrating the validity of the musical stimuli, 
      independent of innate musical bias such as due to episodic memory. Furthermore, 
      musical stimuli could be helpful for further studying perceived musical emotion 
      in people with hearing loss because of the controlled pitch for each emotion.

TI  - Does person-centred care improve outcomes for musicians fitted with hearing 
      protectors?

AB  - Objective: To reduce the risk of hearing injury, musicians are often recommended 
      custom-made musicians' hearing protectors (MHP). Studies report benefits of use 
      however, many still report challenges leading to relatively low uptake and 
      inconsistent usage. Person-centred approaches to health have been shown to 
      improve patient outcomes, and these principles may be translatable to musicians' 
      hearing care. The aim was to investigate if use of, and satisfaction with, MHP is 
      influenced by the treatment delivered to musicians by audiologists.Design: 
      Participants were randomly allocated to one of four conditions that varied in 
      extent of person-centred care.Study sample: Forty-two musicians with an interest 
      in purchasing MHP were recruited.Results: Satisfaction with MHP was high overall 
      and users reported a reduction in incidence of tinnitus. Participants reported 
      few issues related to sound quality, however insertion difficulty was the main 
      problem reported. Only one musician self-identified the need for alterations to 
      their MHP.Conclusions: Adoption of person-centred approaches to MHP was not found 
      to increase likelihood of use, however, satisfaction was high across all 
      conditions. Most often, the need for MHP alterations were clinician-identified 
      during fitting appointments or follow-up contact, underscoring the importance of 
      including these components when providing audiological services to musicians.

TI  - Sound exposures and hearing thresholds of symphony orchestra musicians.
PG  - 2793-803
AB  - To assess the risk of noise-induced hearing loss among musicians in the Chicago 
      Symphony Orchestra, personal dosimeters set to the 3-dB exchange rate were used 
      to obtain 68 noise exposure measurements during rehearsals and concerts. The 
      musicians' Leq values ranged from 79-99 dB A-weighted sound pressure level 
      [dB(A)], with a mean of 89.9 dB(A). Based on 15 h of on-the-job exposure per 
      week, the corresponding 8-h daily Leq (excluding off-the-job practice and 
      playing) ranged from 75-95 dB(A) with a mean of 85.5 dB(A). Mean hearing 
      threshold levels (HTLs) for 59 musicians were better than those for an unscreened 
      nonindustral noise-exposed population (NINEP), and only slightly worse than the 
      0.50 fractile data for the ISO 7029 (1984) screened presbycusis population. 
      However, 52.5% of individual musicians showed notched audiograms consistent with 
      noise-induced hearing damage. Violinists and violists showed significantly poorer 
      thresholds at 3-6 kHz in the left ear than in the right ear, consistent with the 
      left ear's greater exposure from their instruments. After HTLs were corrected for 
      age and sex, HTLs were found to be significantly better for both ears of 
      musicians playing bass, cello, harp, or piano and for the right ears of 
      violinists and violists than for their left ears or for both ears of other 
      musicians. For 32 musicians for whom both HTLs and Leq were obtained, HTLs at 3-6 
      kHz were found to be correlated with the Leq measured.

TI  - Reducing Risk of Noise-Induced Hearing Loss in Collegiate Music Ensembles Using 
      Ambient Technology.
PG  - 132-138
LID - 10.21091/mppa.2017.3024 [doi]
AB  - Student musicians are at risk for noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) as they 
      develop skills and perform during instructional activities. Studies using 
      longitudinal dosimeter data show that pedagogical procedures and instructor 
      behaviors are highly predictive of NIHL risk, thus implying the need for 
      innovative approaches to increase instructor competency in managing instructional 
      activities without interfering with artistic and academic freedom. Ambient 
      information systems, an emerging trend in human-computer interaction that infuses 
      psychological behavioral theories into technologies, can help construct 
      informative risk-regulating systems. The purpose of this study was to determine 
      the effects of introducing an ambient information system into the ensemble 
      setting. The system used two ambient displays and a counterbalanced 
      within-subjects treatment study design with six jazz ensemble instructors to 
      determine if the system could induce a behavior change that alters trends in 
      measures resulting from dosimeter data. This study assessed efficacy using time 
      series analysis to determine changes in eight statistical measures of behavior 
      over a 9-wk period. Analysis showed that the system was effective, as all 
      instructors showed changes in a combination of measures. This study is in an 
      important step in developing non-interfering technology to reduce NIHL among 
      academic musicians.

TI  - Sound exposure of professional orchestral musicians during solitary practice.
PG  - 2748-54
LID - 10.1121/1.4820900 [doi]
AB  - It is broadly acknowledged that professional orchestral musicians risk 
      noise-induced hearing pathologies due to sound exposure in rehearsal and 
      performance. While much has been published regarding orchestral sound levels, 
      little is known of the sound exposure these musicians experience during solitary 
      practice, despite the many hours they spend engaged in this activity. This study 
      aimed to determine sound exposure during solitary practice of 35 professional 
      orchestral musicians, representing players of most orchestral instruments. To 
      allow cross-comparison, participants were assessed playing similar repertoire in 
      a controlled environment, recording simultaneously at each ear to determine sound 
      exposure levels. Sound levels were recorded between 60 and 107 dB L(Aeq), with 
      peak levels between 101 and 130 dB L(C,peak). For average reported practice 
      durations (2.1 h per day, five days a week) 53% would exceed accepted permissible 
      daily noise exposure in solitary practice, in addition to sound exposure during 
      orchestral rehearsals and performances. Significant inter-aural differences were 
      noted in violin, viola, flute/piccolo, horn, trombone, and tuba. Only 40% used 
      hearing protection at any time while practicing. These findings indicate 
      orchestral musicians at risk of noise-induced hearing loss in ensemble face 
      significant additional risks during solitary practice. Data presented will enable 
      more effective and targeted management strategies for this population.

AB  - Music plays a more important role in our life than just being an entertainment. 
      For example, it can be used as an anti-anxiety therapy of human and animals. 
      However, the unsafe listening of loud music triggers hearing loss in millions of 
      young people and professional musicians (rock, jazz and symphony orchestra) owing 
      to exposure to damaging sound levels using personal audio devices or at noisy 
      entertainment venues including nightclubs, discotheques, bars and concerts. 
      Therefore, it is important to understand how loud music affects us. In this 
      pioneering study on healthy mice, we discover that loud rock music below the 
      safety threshold causes opening of the blood-brain barrier (OBBB), which plays a 
      vital role in protecting the brain from viruses, bacteria and toxins. We clearly 
      demonstrate that listening to loud music during 2 h in an intermittent adaptive 
      regime is accompanied by delayed (1 h after music exposure) and short-lasting to 
      (during 1-4 h) OBBB to low and high molecular weight compounds without cochlear 
      and brain impairments. We present the systemic and molecular mechanisms 
      responsible for music-induced OBBB. Finally, a revision of our traditional 
      knowledge about the BBB nature and the novel strategies in optimizing of 
      sound-mediated methods for brain drug delivery are discussed.

TI  - Risks of developing noise-induced hearing loss in employees of urban music clubs.
PG  - 75-9
AB  - Noise-induced hearing loss has previously been reported among rock musicians. 
      This study sought to determine whether a hazard of noise-induced hearing loss 
      exists for music club employees other than musicians themselves. Sound levels at 
      eight live-music clubs were measured and symptoms of noise exposure in 31 music 
      club employees were assessed by questionnaire. The average sound level at the 
      various clubs during performances ranged from 94.9 to 106.7 dBA. The overall 
      sound level average, including both performance and ambient levels, ranged from 
      91.9 to 99.8 dBA. Symptoms of noise exposure, such as tinnitus and subjective 
      hearing loss, correlated with sound intensity. Only 16% reported regular use of 
      hearing protection. We conclude that employees of music clubs are at substantial 
      risk of developing Noise-Induced Hearing Loss, due to chronic noise exposure 
      which consistently exceeded safe levels. Hearing protection is used much too 
      infrequently. The development of hearing conservation programs for this large 
      group of workers is essential.

TI  - Analysis of audiometric notch as a noise-induced hearing loss phenotype in US 
      youth: data from the National Health And Nutrition Examination Survey, 2005-2010.
PG  - 392-399
LID - 10.1080/14992027.2017.1278799 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bilateral audiometric notch (BN) at 4000-6000 Hz was identified as a 
      noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) phenotype for genetic association analysis in 
      college-aged musicians. This study analysed BN in a sample of US youth. DESIGN: 
      Prevalence of the BN within the study sample was determined and 
      logistic-regression analyses were performed to identify audiologic and other 
      demographic factors associated with BN. Computer-simulated "flat" audiograms were 
      used to estimate potential influence of false-positive rates in estimating the 
      prevalence of the BN. STUDY SAMPLE: 2348 participants (12-19 years) following the 
      inclusion criteria were selected from the National Health and Nutrition 
      Examination Survey data (2005-2010). RESULTS: The prevalence of BN was 16.6%. 
      Almost 55.6% of the participants showed notch in at least one ear. Noise 
      exposure, gender, ethnicity and age showed significant relationship with the BN. 
      Computer simulation revealed that 5.5% of simulated participants with "flat" 
      audiograms showed BN. CONCLUSION: Association of noise exposure with BN suggests 
      that it is a useful NIHL phenotype for genetic association analyses. However, 
      further research is necessary to reduce false-positive rates in notch 
      identification.

TI  - The Impact of Music Training and Working Memory on Speech Recognition in Older 
      Age.
PG  - 4524-4534
LID - 10.1044/2021_JSLHR-20-00426 [doi]
AB  - Purpose Music training has been proposed as a possible tool for auditory training 
      in older adults, as it may improve both auditory and cognitive skills. However, 
      the evidence to support such benefits is mixed. The goal of this study was to 
      determine the differential effects of lifelong musical training and working 
      memory on speech recognition in noise, in older adults. Method A total of 31 
      musicians and nonmusicians aged 65-78 years took part in this cross-sectional 
      study. Participants had a normal pure-tone average, with most having 
      high-frequency hearing loss. Working memory (memory capacity) was assessed with 
      the backward Digit Span test, and speech recognition in noise was assessed with 
      three clinical tests (Quick Speech in Noise, Hearing in Noise Test, and Revised 
      Speech Perception in Noise). Results Findings from this sample of older adults 
      indicate that neither music training nor working memory was associated with 
      differences on the speech recognition in noise measures used in this study. 
      Similarly, duration of music training was not associated with speech-in-noise 
      recognition. Conclusions Results from this study do not support the hypothesis 
      that lifelong music training benefits speech recognition in noise. Similarly, an 
      effect of working memory (memory capacity) was not apparent. While these findings 
      may be related to the relatively small sample size, results across previous 
      studies that investigated these effects have also been mixed. Prospective 
      randomized music training studies may be able to better control for variability 
      in outcomes associated with pre-existing and music training factors, as well as 
      to examine the differential impact of music training and working memory for 
      speech-in-noise recognition in older adults.

TI  - Musical experience and the aging auditory system: implications for cognitive 
      abilities and hearing speech in noise.
PG  - e18082
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0018082 [doi]
LID - e18082
AB  - Much of our daily communication occurs in the presence of background noise, 
      compromising our ability to hear. While understanding speech in noise is a 
      challenge for everyone, it becomes increasingly difficult as we age. Although 
      aging is generally accompanied by hearing loss, this perceptual decline cannot 
      fully account for the difficulties experienced by older adults for hearing in 
      noise. Decreased cognitive skills concurrent with reduced perceptual acuity are 
      thought to contribute to the difficulty older adults experience understanding 
      speech in noise. Given that musical experience positively impacts speech 
      perception in noise in young adults (ages 18-30), we asked whether musical 
      experience benefits an older cohort of musicians (ages 45-65), potentially 
      offsetting the age-related decline in speech-in-noise perceptual abilities and 
      associated cognitive function (i.e., working memory). Consistent with performance 
      in young adults, older musicians demonstrated enhanced speech-in-noise perception 
      relative to nonmusicians along with greater auditory, but not visual, working 
      memory capacity. By demonstrating that speech-in-noise perception and related 
      cognitive function are enhanced in older musicians, our results imply that 
      musical training may reduce the impact of age-related auditory decline.

TI  - Incidence of tinnitus, impaired hearing and musculoskeletal disorders among 
      students enrolled in academic music education--a retrospective cohort study.
PG  - 575-83
AB  - The aim was to determine the incidence of tinnitus, impaired hearing and 
      musculoskeletal disorders among musicians and the relation to the number of 
      practicing hours and/or the instrument type before the onset of symptoms. METHOD: 
      The study base consisted of students enrolled in the School of Music and Music 
      Education at Göteborg University between the years 1980 and 1995. There were 407 
      of the 602 original students that answered a questionnaire (response rate of 
      68%). The questionnaire concerned exposure before and after the enrollment in the 
      Music Academy, as well as onset of symptoms. RESULTS: The highest incidence of 
      symptoms was found for reported tinnitus with a rate of 10.6 per 1000 years of 
      instrumental practice. There was a relationship between exposure to the number of 
      hours of instrumental practice and incidence of impaired hearing. Among the 
      musculoskeletal symptoms the highest incidences per 1000 years of instrumental 
      practice were pain in the neck and in the left shoulder with a rate of 4.4 and 
      4.6 disorders per 1000 years of instrumental practice, respectively. There was 
      2.4 times higher incidence for musculoskeletal disorders in the right hand/wrist 
      and a 2.2 times higher incidence in the left elbow/forearm for musicians who 
      practiced for 20 h or more per week before the onset of disorders compared to 
      those who practiced fewer than 20 h per week when controlling for age and gender. 
      Musicians with a violin or a viola as the main instrument had four times the 
      incidence for right elbow/forearm disorder and twice the incidence of neck pain, 
      pain in the right shoulder and the left elbow/forearm compared to those who had 
      piano as the main instrument.

AB  - Experience-dependent characteristics of auditory function, especially with regard 
      to speech-evoked auditory neurophysiology, have garnered increasing attention in 
      recent years. This interest stems from both pragmatic and theoretical concerns as 
      it bears implications for the prevention and remediation of language-based 
      learning impairment in addition to providing insight into mechanisms engendering 
      experience-dependent changes in human sensory function. Musicians provide an 
      attractive model for studying the experience-dependency of auditory processing in 
      humans due to their distinctive neural enhancements compared to nonmusicians. We 
      have only recently begun to address whether these enhancements are observable 
      early in life, during the initial years of music training when the auditory 
      system is under rapid development, as well as later in life, after the onset of 
      the aging process. Here we review neural enhancements in musically trained 
      individuals across the life span in the context of cellular mechanisms that 
      underlie learning, identified in animal models. Musicians' subcortical 
      physiologic enhancements are interpreted according to a cognitive framework for 
      auditory learning, providing a model in which to study mechanisms of 
      experience-dependent changes in human auditory function.

TI  - Medical phenome of musicians: an investigation of health records collected on 
      9803 musically active individuals.
PG  - 156-168
LID - 10.1111/nyas.14671 [doi]
AB  - Previous studies suggest that musicians may be at higher risk for a set of 
      medical problems; however, this literature has been limited by relatively small 
      sample sizes, self-reports, and lack of controls. To address such limitations, we 
      examined trends in the medical care of musicians in an Electronic Health Record 
      database. On the basis of a collection of keywords and regular expressions in the 
      patients' clinical notes, we identified 9803 "musicians" that we matched for sex, 
      median age (across the medical record), ethnicity, race, the length of record, 
      and the number of visits with 49,015 controls. We fitted 1263 logistic regression 
      models to determine whether the phenotype was correlated with musicianship. Two 
      hundred fifty-seven phenotypes were more prevalent in musicians than controls 
      after Bonferroni adjustment (P < 7.6 × 10(-6) ), including diseases of the larynx 
      and vocal cords (OR = 2.32 (95% CI: 2.25-2.40)), and hearing loss (OR = 1.36 (95% 
      CI: 1.32-1.39)). Fifteen phenotypes were significantly more prevalent in controls 
      than musicians, including coronary atherosclerosis (OR = 0.91 (95% CI: 
      0.89-0.94)). Although being a musician was related to many occupational health 
      problems, we identified protective effects of musicianship in which certain 
      disorders were less common in musicians than in controls, indicating that active 
      musical engagement could have health benefits analogous to athletic engagement.

TI  - Performing arts medicine-a bibliographic retrospective of the early literature: 
      an historical examination of bibliographic references pre-1975.
PG  - 47-53
AB  - Performing arts medicine (PAM) emerged as a medical specialty around 1985. Prior 
      to this time, relatively few publications addressed the identification and 
      concerns of musicians' and dancers' medical problems. To determine what number 
      and types of publications occurred prior to the actual beginnings of PAM as a 
      discipline, and to determine how these original topics compared with present-day 
      publications, a retrospective review of the current bibliographic database of the 
      Performing Arts Medicine Association (PAMA) was undertaken. Out of a total of 
      12,600 entries to date, 489 references were found published from 1798 through 
      1974, which represent only 3.9% of the current database listings. One-sixth of 
      the references were originally written in a language other than English. Journal 
      articles were by far the most numerous type of publication. Topics with the 
      highest number of entries included the neurobiology of music (n=77), 
      dental/orofacial matters (71), and biographical accounts of composers or 
      musicians and their illnesses (59). Other frequently published topics included 
      hearing loss, physiology of playing instruments, and instrumental technique and 
      teaching. Early topics with multiple publications included composers' 
      biographies, dystonias, and surgery to improve finger independence for playing 
      piano. Subjects whose publications occurred principally in the last two decades 
      of this review included dermatological disorders, hearing loss, and ballet 
      physiology, teaching, and technique. Those which remain popular to the present 
      day include hearing loss, performance anxiety, focal dystonia, and 
      dental/orofacial problems.

TI  - Pitch Discrimination in Musicians and Non-Musicians: Effects of Harmonic 
      Resolvability and Processing Effort.
PG  - 69-79
LID - 10.1007/s10162-015-0548-2 [doi]
AB  - Musicians typically show enhanced pitch discrimination abilities compared to 
      non-musicians. The present study investigated this perceptual enhancement 
      behaviorally and objectively for resolved and unresolved complex tones to clarify 
      whether the enhanced performance in musicians can be ascribed to increased 
      peripheral frequency selectivity and/or to a different processing effort in 
      performing the task. In a first experiment, pitch discrimination thresholds were 
      obtained for harmonic complex tones with fundamental frequencies (F0s) between 
      100 and 500 Hz, filtered in either a low- or a high-frequency region, leading to 
      variations in the resolvability of audible harmonics. The results showed that 
      pitch discrimination performance in musicians was enhanced for resolved and 
      unresolved complexes to a similar extent. Additionally, the harmonics became 
      resolved at a similar F0 in musicians and non-musicians, suggesting similar 
      peripheral frequency selectivity in the two groups of listeners. In a follow-up 
      experiment, listeners' pupil dilations were measured as an indicator of the 
      required effort in performing the same pitch discrimination task for conditions 
      of varying resolvability and task difficulty. Pupillometry responses indicated a 
      lower processing effort in the musicians versus the non-musicians, although the 
      processing demand imposed by the pitch discrimination task was individually 
      adjusted according to the behavioral thresholds. Overall, these findings indicate 
      that the enhanced pitch discrimination abilities in musicians are unlikely to be 
      related to higher peripheral frequency selectivity and may suggest an enhanced 
      pitch representation at more central stages of the auditory system in musically 
      trained listeners.

TI  - Auditory risk assessment of college music students in jazz band-based 
      instructional activity.
PG  - 246-52
LID - 10.4103/1463-1741.113520 [doi]
AB  - It is well-known that musicians are at risk for music-induced hearing loss, 
      however, systematic evaluation of music exposure and its effects on the auditory 
      system are still difficult to assess. The purpose of the study was to determine 
      if college students in jazz band-based instructional activity are exposed to loud 
      classroom noise and consequently exhibit acute but significant changes in basic 
      auditory measures compared to non-music students in regular classroom sessions. 
      For this we (1) measured and compared personal exposure levels of college 
      students (n = 14) participating in a routine 50 min jazz ensemble-based 
      instructional activity (experimental) to personal exposure levels of non-music 
      students (n = 11) participating in a 50-min regular classroom activity (control), 
      and (2) measured and compared pre- to post-auditory changes associated with these 
      two types of classroom exposures. Results showed that the L eq (equivalent 
      continuous noise level) generated during the 50 min jazz ensemble-based 
      instructional activity ranged from 95 dBA to 105.8 dBA with a mean of 99.5 ± 2.5 
      dBA. In the regular classroom, the L eq ranged from 46.4 dBA to 67.4 dBA with a 
      mean of 49.9 ± 10.6 dBA. Additionally, significant differences were observed in 
      pre to post-auditory measures between the two groups. The experimental group 
      showed a significant temporary threshold shift bilaterally at 4000 Hz (P < 0.05), 
      and a significant decrease in the amplitude of transient-evoked otoacoustic 
      emission response in both ears (P < 0.05) after exposure to the jazz 
      ensemble-based instructional activity. No significant changes were found in the 
      control group between pre- and post-exposure measures. This study quantified the 
      noise exposure in jazz band-based practice sessions and its effects on basic 
      auditory measures. Temporary, yet significant, auditory changes seen in music 
      students place them at risk for hearing loss compared to their non-music cohorts.

TI  - Hearing development in classical orchestral musicians. A follow-up study.
PG  - 141-9
AB  - Using pure tone audiometry in 1995, a hearing reassessment was made in 56 
      classical musicians who participated in Axelsson & Lindgren's study 16 years 
      earlier, in 1979. This study focuses on hearing development in these classical 
      orchestra musicians, active in Göteborg, Sweden. The aim of the study is to 
      evaluate the risk of progressive hearing loss during work in a classical 
      orchestra. Another aim is to study possible hearing differences in females and 
      males and to compare the high frequency pure-tone average values found in the 
      study with two normal materials. The main findings were that the male, compared 
      to the female musicians, showed a tendency toward a more pronounced, although not 
      significant, hearing reduction in the high frequency region and higher threshold 
      distribution within the 90th percentile than the females. This was found most 
      often in the left ear. The median audiogram for all females showed a notch 
      configuration at 6 kHz, compared to the males who had a high-tone sloping 
      configuration. When comparing high frequency pure-tone average (HFPTA) values 
      with ISO 7029, the females are distributed around the ISO 7029 median and well 
      within the 90th percentile. The average among the males was equal with the 
      median. Comparison with Davis normal population "all the sample, overall 
      occupational group" showed a more even distribution of the HFPTA values around 
      the median for both females and males on both occasions. This follow-up study 
      showed no extended negative progress of the pure-tone hearing threshold values in 
      spite of an additional 16 years of musical noise exposure.

TI  - Hearing in pop/rock musicians: a follow-up study.
PG  - 245-53
AB  - In 1975, the threshold hearing levels (HLs) of 83 Swedish and British pop/rock 
      musicians were examined with pure tone audiometry. At that time we found 13% of 
      the musicians with a hearing loss > 20 dB HL at a high frequency pure tone 
      average (3, 4, 6, and 8 kHz). The aim of the present investigation was to conduct 
      an audiometric follow-up study of these musicians 16 years after the first 
      examination. Fifty-three of the 83 pop/rock musicians were retested in 1991 to 
      1992. They also filled in a questionnaire concerning occupational noise 
      activities, leisure noise activities, general health problems and subjective 
      symptoms related to loud music exposure. The median pure tone audiogram was 
      within 20 dB HL at all test frequencies. On an individual basis, 63% had normal 
      high high frequency pure tone average scores and another 15% had a very limited 
      high frequency hearing loss (< or = 25 dB HL). It seems surprising that pop/rock 
      musicians after performing for 26 years have such well-preserved hearing. There 
      might be a protective effect by the generally positive attitude from the 
      musicians toward their performance and their audience. Regarding the loud and 
      more or less continuous sound levels over 85 dBA there might also be a protective 
      effect from a continuous contraction of the stapedius muscle.

TI  - Validation of clinical techniques for verification of uniform attenuation 
      earplugs.
PG  - S33-S39
LID - 10.1080/14992027.2018.1532119 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Uniform attenuation earplugs (UAE) theoretically provide near even 
      attenuation across frequencies when built to a manufacturer's specifications. 
      Unfortunately, there is no current research available confirming if custom-molded 
      uniform attenuation earplugs (UAE) are made to specifications nor is there 
      guidance available on clinical methods of measuring attenuation of uniform 
      attenuation earplug (UAE) devices. The goal of this study was to evaluate 
      different procedures for UAE verification and to determine the most accurate 
      clinically accessible verification protocol. DESIGN: Attenuation was measured 
      using probe microphone techniques, as well as real-ear attenuation at threshold 
      (REAT) measurements under circumaural earphones, soundfield speakers and 
      supra-aural earphones. Comparisons were made to a reference system created in the 
      laboratory. STUDY SAMPLE: Seventeen adult participants, totaling 30 ears. 
      RESULTS: The results of this study demonstrate that the REAT measured in the 
      soundfield using a narrowband noise stimulus with masking in the contralateral 
      ear is currently the most accurate and widely available method of verifying UAEs. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Factoring in clinical efficiency, the authors of this study 
      recommend verifying attenuation levels using a soundfield REAT procedure as best 
      clinical practice. In addition, the data suggests that REAT measurements under 
      circumaural earphones are an acceptable second choice method.

AB  - The objective of this research was to study musicians' abilities to estimate the 
      risk to obtain a hearing loss. Twenty-two professional musicians mainly playing 
      classical music wore dosimeters during 2 working weeks. They also wrote a diary 
      describing all their musical activities and tried to judge the percentage of time 
      that every activity was harmful to their hearing. Half of the musicians seemed to 
      be capable to reasonably judge the harmfulness of the music that they were 
      exposed to. They started to judge the levels to be risky at 80 dB(A) and regarded 
      themselves as slightly more susceptible to noise induced hearing loss than 
      normal.

TI  - Cochlear implant users rely on tempo rather than on pitch information during 
      perception of musical emotion.
PG  - S114-20
LID - 10.1179/1467010015Z.000000000265 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to investigate the extent to which 
      cochlear implant (CI) users rely on tempo and mode in perception of musical 
      emotion when compared with normal hearing (NH) individuals. METHODS: A test 
      battery of novel four-bar melodies was created and adapted to four permutations 
      with alterations of tonality (major vs. minor) and tempo (presto vs. largo), 
      resulting in non-ambiguous (major key/fast tempo and minor key/slow tempo) and 
      ambiguous (major key/slow tempo, and minor key/fast tempo) musical stimuli. Both 
      CI and NH participants listened to each clip and provided emotional ratings on a 
      Likert scale of +5 (happy) to -5 (sad). RESULTS: A three-way ANOVA demonstrated 
      an overall effect for tempo in both groups, and an overall effect for mode in the 
      NH group. The CI group rated stimuli of the same tempo similarly, regardless of 
      changes in mode, whereas the NH group did not. A subgroup analysis indicated the 
      same effects in both musician and non-musician CI users and NH listeners. 
      DISCUSSION: The results suggest that the CI group relied more heavily on tempo 
      than mode in making musical emotion decisions. The subgroup analysis further 
      suggests that level of musical training did not significantly impact this 
      finding. CONCLUSION: CI users weigh temporal cues more heavily than pitch cues in 
      inferring musical emotion. These findings highlight the significant disadvantage 
      of CI users in comparison with NH listeners for music perception, particularly 
      during recognition of musical emotion, a critically important feature of music.

PG  - 1545-59
LID - 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.01.067 [doi]
AB  - The steady-state auditory evoked magnetic field was recorded in tinnitus patients 
      and controls, both either musicians or non-musicians, all of them with 
      high-frequency hearing loss. Stimuli were AM-tones with two modulation 
      frequencies and three carrier frequencies matching the "audiometric edge", i.e. 
      the frequency above which hearing loss increases more rapidly, the tinnitus 
      frequency or the frequency 1 1/2 octaves above the audiometric edge in controls, 
      and a frequency 1 1/2 octaves below the audiometric edge. Stimuli equated in 
      carrier frequency, but differing in modulation frequency, were simultaneously 
      presented to the two ears. The modulation frequency-specific components of the 
      dual steady-state response were recovered by bandpass filtering. In both 
      hemispheres, the source amplitude of the response was larger for contralateral 
      than ipsilateral input. In non-musicians with tinnitus, this laterality effect 
      was enhanced in the hemisphere contralateral and reduced in the hemisphere 
      ipsilateral to the tinnitus ear, especially for the tinnitus frequency. The 
      hemisphere-by-input laterality dominance effect was smaller in musicians than in 
      non-musicians. In both patient groups, source amplitude change over time, i.e. 
      amplitude slope, was increasing with tonal frequency for contralateral input and 
      decreasing for ipsilateral input. However, slope was smaller for musicians than 
      non-musicians. In patients, source amplitude was negatively correlated with the 
      MRI-determined volume of the medial partition of Heschl's gyrus. Tinnitus 
      patients show an altered excitatory-inhibitory balance reflecting the 
      downregulation of inhibition and resulting in a steeper dominance hierarchy among 
      simultaneous processes in auditory cortex. Direction and extent of this 
      alteration are modulated by musicality and auditory cortex volume.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the contribution of all daily activities, including 
      non-music activities, to the overall noise exposure of college student musicians, 
      and to compare their "noise lives" with those of non-musician college students. 
      DESIGN: Continuous week-long dosimetry measurements were collected on student 
      musicians and non-musicians. During the measurement period, participants recorded 
      their daily activities in journals. STUDY SAMPLE: 22 musicians and 40 
      non-musicians, all students (aged 18-24 years) at the University of Connecticut. 
      RESULTS: On every day of the week, musicians experienced significantly higher 
      average exposure levels than did non-musicians. Nearly half (47%) of the 
      musicians' days exceeded a daily dose of 100%, compared with 10% of the 
      non-musicians' days. When the exposure due to music activities was removed, 
      musicians still led noisier lives, largely due to participation in noisier social 
      activities. For some musicians, non-music activities contributed a larger share 
      of their total weekly noise exposure than did their music activities. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Compared with their non-musician peers, college student musicians 
      are at higher risk for noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). On a weekly basis, 
      non-music activities may pose a greater risk to some musicians than music 
      activities. Thus, hearing health education for musicians should include 
      information about the contribution of lifestyle factors outside of music to NIHL 
      risk.

AB  - Musical training and experience greatly enhance the cortical and subcortical

      Auditory temporal resolution is a fundamental perceptual aspect that is critical 
      for speech understanding in noise in listeners with normal hearing, auditory 
      disorders, cochlear implants, and language disorders, yet very few studies have 
      focused on music-induced learning of temporal resolution. This report 
      demonstrates that Carnatic musical training and experience have a significant 
      impact on temporal resolution assayed by gap detection thresholds. This 
      experience-dependent learning in Carnatic-trained musicians exhibits the 
      universal aspects of human perception and plasticity. The present work adds the 
      perceptual component to a growing body of neurophysiological and imaging studies 
      that suggest plasticity of the peripheral auditory system at the level of the 
      brainstem. The present work may be intriguing to researchers and clinicians alike 
      interested in devising cross-cultural training regimens to alleviate 
      listening-in-noise difficulties.

TI  - Potential hazard of hearing damage to students in undergraduate popular music 
      courses.
PG  - 175-82
AB  - In recent years, there has been a rapid growth in university courses related to 
      popular and commercial music, with a commensurate increase in the number of 
      students studying these courses. Students of popular music subjects are 
      frequently involved in the use of electronically amplified sound for rehearsal 
      and recording, in addition to the "normal" noise exposure commonly associated 
      with young people. The combination of these two elements suggests a higher than 
      average noise exposure hazard for these students. To date, the majority of noise 
      studies on students have focused on exposure from personal music players and on 
      classical, orchestral, and marching band musicians. One hundred students across a 
      range of university popular music courses were surveyed using a 30-point 
      questionnaire regarding their musical habits both within and external to their 
      university courses. This was followed by noise dosimetry of studios/recording 
      spaces and music venues popular with students. Questionnaire responses showed 76% 
      of subjects reported having experienced symptoms associated with hearing loss, 
      while only 18% reported using hearing protection devices. Rehearsals averaged 
      11.5 hrs/wk, with a mean duration 2 hrs 13 mins and mean level of 98 dB LAEQ. 
      Ninety-four percent of subjects reported attending concerts or nightclubs at 
      least once per week, and measured exposure in two of these venues ranged from 98 
      to 112 dB LAEQ with a mean of 98.9 dB LAEQ over a 4.5-hr period. Results 
      suggested an extremely high hazard of excessive noise exposure among this group 
      from both their social and study-based music activities.

TI  - Musical Experience Offsets Age-Related Decline in Understanding Speech-in-Noise: 
      Type of Training Does Not Matter, Working Memory Is the Key.
PG  - 258-270
LID - 10.1097/AUD.0000000000000921 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Speech comprehension under "cocktail party" scenarios deteriorates 
      with age even in the absence of measurable hearing loss. Musical training is 
      suggested to counteract the age-related decline in speech-in-noise (SIN) 
      perception, yet which aspect of musical plasticity contributes to this 
      compensation remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effects of 
      musical experience and aging on SIN perception ability. We hypothesized a key 
      mediation role of auditory working memory in ameliorating deficient SIN 
      perception in older adults by musical training. DESIGN: Forty-eight older 
      musicians, 29 older nonmusicians, 48 young musicians, and 24 young nonmusicians 
      all with (near) normal peripheral hearing were recruited. The SIN task was 
      recognizing nonsense speech sentences either perceptually colocated or separated 
      with a noise masker (energetic masking) or a two-talker speech masker 
      (informational masking). Auditory working memory was measured by auditory digit 
      span. Path analysis was used to examine the direct and indirect effects of 
      musical expertise and age on SIN perception performance. RESULTS: Older musicians 
      outperformed older nonmusicians in auditory working memory and all SIN conditions 
      (noise separation, noise colocation, speech separation, speech colocation), but 
      such musician advantages were absent in young adults. Path analysis showed that 
      age and musical training had opposite effects on auditory working memory, which 
      played a significant mediation role in SIN perception. In addition, the type of 
      musical training did not differentiate SIN perception regardless of age. 
      CONCLUSIONS: These results provide evidence that musical training offsets 
      age-related speech perception deficit at adverse listening conditions by 
      preserving auditory working memory. Our findings highlight auditory working 
      memory in supporting speech perception amid competing noise in older adults, and 
      underline musical training as a means of "cognitive reserve" against declines in 
      speech comprehension and cognition in aging populations.

AB  - As musicians have been shown to have a range of superior auditory skills to 
      non-musicians (e.g., pitch discrimination ability), it has been hypothesized by 
      many researchers that music training can have a beneficial effect on speech 
      perception in populations with hearing impairment. This hypothesis relies on an 
      assumption that the benefits seen in musicians are due to their training and not 
      due to innate skills that may support successful musicianship. This systematic 
      review examined the evidence from 13 longitudinal training studies that tested 
      the hypothesis that music training has a causal effect on speech perception 
      ability in hearing-impaired listeners. The papers were evaluated for quality of 
      research design and appropriate analysis techniques. Only 4 of the 13 papers used 
      a research design that allowed a causal relation between music training and 
      outcome benefits to be validly tested, and none of those 4 papers with a better 
      quality study design demonstrated a benefit of music training for speech 
      perception. In spite of the lack of valid evidence in support of the hypothesis, 
      10 of the 13 papers made claims of benefits of music training, showing a 
      propensity for confirmation bias in this area of research. It is recommended that 
      future studies that aim to evaluate the association of speech perception ability 
      and music training use a study design that differentiates the effects of training 
      from those of innate perceptual and cognitive skills in the participants.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Noise-induced hearing loss has increased due to factors such as 
      industrialization. It is estimated that one third of the world's population 
      suffers from some degree of hearing loss caused by exposure to high-intensity 
      noise. Exposure to noise can cause disease of various ear structures, especially 
      destruction of outer hair cells, causing varying degrees of hearing 
      lossObjective: To describe the audiological findings in a group of subjects who 
      were exposed to a source of fireworks explosion in the state of Tlaxcala Mexico. 
      METHODOLOGY: We carried out an audiometric study in eight patients admitted to 
      CENIAQ-INR who were exposed to a firecracker explosion. In each subject, airway 
      with conventional pure tone audiometry from 125 to 8000 Hz was assessed using a 
      clinical audiometer (model 622, Minimate, Madsen) Clinical case: Hearing loss at 
      all frequencies was found in all eight patients, from mild to severe in both 
      ears. Audiogram showed decreases from 4000 Hz, diagnosing third-degree acoustic 
      trauma in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: The main symptom was reported by patients 
      with tinnitus. Other scenarios in which patients report the presence of tinnitus 
      are acoustic trauma due to use of audio players in symphony orchestra musicians 
      and detonating military firearms. Audiometric assessment is recommended after an 
      explosive accident as an accurate method to determine if there is any hearing 
      impairment.

TI  - Characteristics of noise exposure during solitary trumpet playing: immediate 
      impact on distortion-product otoacoustic emissions and long-term implications for 
      hearing.
PG  - 543-53
LID - 10.1097/AUD.0b013e31824c0935 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this investigation were to quantify noise exposures 
      generated during a 1 hr trumpet practice session and to determine whether 
      distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) are affected by such exposure, 
      to describe the distribution of intensity levels and temporal characteristics of 
      noise produced by trumpet practice, and to determine the effect of earplug use on 
      generated noise levels and DPOAEs. DESIGN: In experiment 1, eight college-age 
      trumpeters underwent an otoscopic inspection, tympanometry, and pure-tone 
      threshold testing. Using a Grason-Stadler 60 DPOAE system, DPOAEs were recorded 
      just before a 1 hr practice session, at 2 min after the practice session, 4 min 
      after the session, and at 4 min intervals thereafter for a total period of 1 hr. 
      A Hewlett-Packard 3569A Real-Time Frequency Analyzer was used to integrate noise 
      levels to assess the overall level of exposure averaged over the course of the 
      hour. In experiment 2, seven different trumpeters participated in two 
      data-collection sessions. The main difference between the sessions was that 
      subjects wore E.A.R. earplugs during session 2. All other design parameters were 
      similar to those of experiment 1. RESULTS: Noise levels generated during the 
      practice sessions resulted in average Leqs of 95.96, 96.6, and 96.43 dB SPL. A 
      sound-distribution analysis revealed that noise levels exceeded 85 dB for an 
      average of 43.73 min per session. Mean Leq values did not change when subjects 
      wore earplugs (96.6 dB SPL versus 96.43 dB SPL.) Predictions (ISO 1999) of the 
      increased risk of hearing loss that trumpeters would experience at 40, 50, and 60 
      years of age were made and indicated that trumpeters are at a significantly 
      increased risk of hearing loss over that contributable to age alone. This 
      increased risk is apparent with as little as 1 hr of exposure per day and 
      suggests that 60-year-old male and female musicians exposed to trumpet noise for 
      4 hr per day for 40 years would be 85% and 300%, respectively, more likely to 
      have hearing loss than their peers with negative noise exposure histories. 
      Statistically significant decreases in DPOAE amplitudes from the prenoise 
      exposure collection point to the 2 min post exposure point were observed only 
      when subjects were not wearing earplugs during their practice session. Recovery 
      of DPOAEs to baseline level varied in form for four test frequencies. CONCLUSION: 
      During solitary play, trumpeters generate noise levels that temporarily decrease 
      DPOAE amplitudes and that by themselves have the potential to result in permanent 
      noise-induced hearing loss. Trumpeters who practice/perform over a period of 
      years should be concerned about the implications of their craft on their hearing 
      and should be offered personalized hearing conservation programs. The use of 
      earplugs offers a practical and cost-effective means of hearing protection and, 
      for this group of trumpeters, did not lead to an increase in playing level.

TI  - Sound Exposure of Healthcare Professionals Working with a University Marching 
      Band.
PG  - 83-89
LID - 10.3766/jaaa.17018 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Music-induced hearing disorders are known to result from exposure to 
      excessive levels of music of different genres. Marching band music, with its 
      heavy emphasis on brass and percussion, is one type that is a likely contributor 
      to music-induced hearing disorders, although specific data on sound pressure 
      levels of marching bands have not been widely studied. Furthermore, if marching 
      band music does lead to music-induced hearing disorders, the musicians may not be 
      the only individuals at risk. Support personnel such as directors, equipment 
      managers, and performing arts healthcare providers may also be exposed to 
      potentially damaging sound pressures. Thus, we sought to explore to what degree 
      healthcare providers receive sound dosages above recommended limits during their 
      work with a marching band. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine 
      the sound exposure of healthcare professionals (specifically, athletic trainers 
      [ATs]) who provide on-site care to a large, well-known university marching band. 
      We hypothesized that sound pressure levels to which these individuals were 
      exposed would exceed the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health 
      (NIOSH) daily percentage allowance. RESEARCH DESIGN: Descriptive observational 
      study. STUDY SAMPLE: Eight ATs working with a well-known American university 
      marching band volunteered to wear noise dosimeters. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: 
      During the marching band season, ATs wore an Etymotic ER-200D dosimeter whenever 
      working with the band at outdoor rehearsals, indoor field house rehearsals, and 
      outdoor performances. The dosimeters recorded dose percent exposure, equivalent 
      continuous sound levels in A-weighted decibels, and duration of exposure. For 
      comparison, a dosimeter also was worn by an AT working in the university's 
      performing arts medicine clinic. Participants did not alter their typical duties 
      during any data collection sessions. Sound data were collected with the 
      dosimeters set at the NIOSH standards of 85 dBA threshold and 3 dBA exchange 
      rate; the NIOSH 100% daily dose is an exposure to 85 dBA over 8 h. Dose data for 
      each session were converted to a standardized dose intensity by dividing the dose 
      percentage by the duration of the exposure and setting the NIOSH standard as a 
      factor of 1.0. This allowed convenient relative comparisons of dose percentages 
      of vastly different exposure durations. Analysis of variance examined 
      relationships of noise exposures among the venues; post hoc testing was used to 
      assess pairwise differences. RESULTS: As hypothesized, ATs were exposed to high 
      sound pressure levels and dose percentages greatly exceeding those recommended by 
      NIOSH. Higher sound levels were recorded in performance venues compared with 
      rehearsal venues. In addition to the band music, crowd noise and public address 
      systems contribute to high sound levels at performances. CONCLUSIONS: Our results 
      suggest that healthcare providers working with marching bands are exposed to 
      dangerous levels of sound during performances. This is especially true at venues 
      such as football stadiums, where crowd noise and public address systems add to 
      sound pressure. A hearing conservation program, including protection, should be 
      required for all healthcare staff who work with marching bands. Moreover, our 
      results should inform hearing conservation practices for marching musicians, 
      directors, and support personnel.

TI  - Hearing ability in Danish symphony orchestra musicians.
PG  - 43-49
AB  - The audiograms of fifty-seven musicians from four Danish symphony orchestras were 
      determined in connection with an interview about their working experience. 
      Measurements of sound levels and noise dose were performed during rehearsal and 
      during concerts in the four orchestras with the measurement equipment placed in 
      various instrument groups. The average audiogram showed a decrease at higher 
      frequencies similar to an age-related hearing loss. Each audiogram was corrected 
      for the age of the person by means of the median from ISO 7029 and the average 
      audiogram from these age-corrected individual audiograms showed no signs of 
      hearing loss. The audiograms were also compared to the expected audiograms from 
      ISO 1999, which takes account of the number of years at work, the number of 
      playing hours per week, and the average sound level in the orchestra for the 
      instrument group. In almost all cases the measured audiograms looked better than 
      the predictions from ISO 1999. It may be concluded from this investigation that 
      musicians cannot be expected to get pronounced audiometric hearing losses from 
      playing in a symphony orchestra. It should be noted, though, that the data 
      material is limited, and that the subjects have not been selected in a 
      systematically or representative way.

TI  - Parametric method for the noise risk assessment of professional orchestral 
      musicians.
PG  - 319-328
LID - 10.4103/1463-1741.195797 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Occupational Health and Safety (OH&S) literature shows that noise 
      could represent a risk factor for professional orchestral musicians. The 
      continuative exposition to elevated noise levels and the particular nature of the 
      activity make necessary an "atypical" OH&S approach, which was identified to be 
      necessarily organizational. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, a 
      parametric-based method for orchestral exposure assessment and management was 
      developed. The goal was to achieve a predictive tool to involve safety in the 
      decision making of concert season program. After setting the parameters, the 
      project's hypothesis was defined and then validated through a yearly-scale 
      monitoring on an important European symphonic orchestra. Moreover, workers' 
      exposure was assessed from the parametric study by a wide measurement campaign. 
      RESULTS: A general validation of the method was obtained by the verification of 
      the main parameters' (repertoire, headcount, and disposition) significant 
      influence on the sound pressure levels produced by the orchestra. Exposure levels 
      comparable to the trends in literature for symphonic orchestras were observed, 
      with criticalities among brass musicians, which was the only group exceeding the 
      upper exposure action values. CONCLUSION: This research has emphasized that the 
      exposure condition of musicians can be critical and requires the implementation 
      of improvement plans. The study has shown that the predictive analysis can be 
      performed on parameters describing the concert's emissive characteristics. The 
      future development of research currently under study will focus on the concert's 
      pieces and the use of parameters as indicators of the exposure context.

      users.
PG  - S105-13

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Satisfactory musical sound quality remains a challenge for many 
      cochlear implant (CI) users. In particular, questionnaires completed by CI users 
      suggest that reverberation due to room acoustics can negatively impact their 
      music listening experience. The objective of this study was to more specifically 
      characterize of the effect of reverberation on musical sound quality in CI users, 
      normal hearing (NH) non-musicians, and NH musicians using a previously designed 
      assessment method, called Cochlear Implant-MUltiple Stimulus with Hidden 
      Reference and Anchor (CI-MUSHRA). METHODS: In this method, listeners were 
      randomly presented with an anechoic musical segment and five-versions of this 
      segment in which increasing amounts of reverberation were artificially added. 
      Participants listened to the six reverberation versions and provided sound 
      quality ratings between 0 (very poor) and 100 (excellent). RESULTS: Results 
      demonstrated that on average CI users and NH non-musicians preferred the sound 
      quality of anechoic versions to more reverberant versions. In comparison, NH 
      musicians could be delineated into those who preferred the sound quality of 
      anechoic pieces and those who preferred pieces with some reverberation. 
      DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: This is the first study, to our knowledge, to objectively 
      compare the effects of reverberation on musical sound quality ratings in CI 
      users. These results suggest that musical sound quality for CI users can be 
      improved by non-reverberant listening conditions and musical stimuli in which 
      reverberation is removed.

TI  - The hearing of symphony orchestra musicians.
PG  - 257-64
AB  - The question has recently been raised as to whether the performance of symphony 
      orchestra music involves a risk of sustaining hearing impairment. The following 
      investigation presents a population study of 417 musicians, of whom 123 were 
      investigated twice, at an interval of 6 years. Median values of screened tone 
      thresholds were compared with a reference material, according to Spoor & 
      Passchier-Vermeer (1969). The tone thresholds measured did not differ from the 
      reference values although the actual sound exposure in some situations exceeded 
      the permitted sound levels applied to industrial noise. We suggest that the sound 
      exposure criteria for industrial noise are not valid when discussing such sounds 
      as are produced by acoustic instruments in a symphonic environment.

AB  - Older adults frequently complain that while they can hear a person talking, they 
      cannot understand what is being said; this difficulty is exacerbated by 
      background noise. Peripheral hearing loss cannot fully account for this 
      age-related decline in speech-in-noise ability, as declines in central processing 
      also contribute to this problem. Given that musicians have enhanced 
      speech-in-noise perception, we aimed to define the effects of musical experience 
      on subcortical responses to speech and speech-in-noise perception in middle-aged 
      adults. Results reveal that musicians have enhanced neural encoding of speech in 
      quiet and noisy settings. Enhancements include faster neural response timing, 
      higher neural response consistency, more robust encoding of speech harmonics, and 
      greater neural precision. Taken together, we suggest that musical experience 
      provides perceptual benefits in an aging population by strengthening the 
      underlying neural pathways necessary for the accurate representation of important 
      temporal and spectral features of sound.

TI  - Valencia's Cathedral Church Bell Acoustics Impact on the Hearing Abilities of 
      Bell Ringers.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph16091564 [doi]
LID - 1564
AB  - Studies on the effect of occupational noise have been widely performed for 
      occupations such as construction workers, workers of factories or even musicians 
      and workers of nightclubs. However, studies on the acoustics of church bells are 
      very scarce and usually reported in languages other than English. In Spain, 
      although the tradition of bell ringers is progressively getting lost, some bell 
      ringers that continue transmitting the tradition remain. Church bells create 
      sound with a large sound pressure level that can be heard from a great distance. 
      However, despite the characteristics of the sound of church bells, bell ringers 
      do not present symptoms of occupational hearing loss unlike musicians and 
      construction workers. To determine the effects of the sound of the church bells 
      on bell ringers, in this paper, an acoustic study of the church bells and a 
      physiological study of the hearing abilities of bell ringers. Results show sound 
      pressure levels reaching 120 dB inside the bell tower. The resulting hearing loss 
      in bell ringers is small considering the great intensity of the sound produced by 
      the bells. This is likely due to the short amount of time that bell ringers are 
      exposed to the sound even if it reaches high sound pressure levels.

TI  - [The level of the musical loud sound and noise induced hearing impairment].
PG  - 151-61
AB  - Recently, there has been an increasing number of reports concerning hearing 
      impairment which musical loud sound is thought to be one of the causes. We are 
      getting more of this musical loud sound as cassette tape recorders with head 
      phones such as Walkman and so forth get popular as well as occasions to attending 
      rock concerts and going to discotheques increase. This hearing impairment is 
      generally called discotheque deafness and the following three types are 
      considered; 1) deafness which have fixed by accumulation of loud sound over a 
      long period of time as seen in people involved in musical performance such as 
      rock musicians and mixing engineers; 2) abrupt noise induced hearing impairment 
      triggered by loud sound and 3) state of deafness which is a progressing stage 
      towards recovery of noise induced temporary threshold shift (NITTS), which occurs 
      temporarily by a loud sound stimulus, and hearing ability recovers afterward. 
      However, it is considered that these musical loud sounds not only changes every 
      moment according to method of performing or type of music, but the volume of the 
      sound actually reaching the auditory sense differs largely by locations and 
      direction of the ear and speakers. So it becomes necessary to measure the 
      accumulation of the noise which each individual is exposed under over a long 
      period of time and at the same time carry out the regular medical checkups 
      including hearing test to check the initiation and advancement of the noise 
      induced hearing impairment. Then we can examine the relationship between loudness 
      of the environmental noise and initiation and advancement of the hearing 
      impairment. However, there has not been a device which is compact and measures 
      noise exposure individually over a long period of time. So we have experimentally 
      produced ultra compact noise dosimeter which we named Noise Badge, and with it we 
      actually measured individual noise exposure over a long time in rock music, noise 
      in discotheque and noisy factory. Then we examined the relationship between these 
      loud sound and noise induced temporary threshold shift (NITTS) in discotheques 
      and noise proof room using simulation of loud sound exposure. Moreover, we 
      measured the most comfortable loudness level of head phones in each examine and 
      different types of music with environmental noise in consideration, thus 
      examining the relationship between musical loud sound and the hearing impairment.

TI  - Jumpstarting auditory learning in children with cochlear implants through music 
      experiences.
PG  - S51-62

AB  - Musical experiences are a valuable part of the lives of children with cochlear 
      implants (CIs). In addition to the pleasure, relationships and emotional outlet 
      provided by music, it serves to enhance or 'jumpstart' other auditory and 
      cognitive skills that are critical for development and learning throughout the 
      lifespan. Musicians have been shown to be 'better listeners' than non-musicians 
      with regard to how they perceive and process sound. A heuristic model of music 
      therapy is reviewed, including six modulating factors that may account for the 
      auditory advantages demonstrated by those who participate in music therapy. The 
      integral approach to music therapy is described along with the hybrid approach to 
      pediatric language intervention. These approaches share the characteristics of 
      placing high value on ecologically valid therapy experiences, i.e., engaging in 
      'real' music and 'real' communication. Music and language intervention techniques 
      used by the authors are presented. It has been documented that children with CIs 
      consistently have lower music perception scores than do their peers with normal 
      hearing (NH). On the one hand, this finding matters a great deal because it 
      provides parameters for setting reasonable expectations and highlights the work 
      still required to improve signal processing with the devices so that they more 
      accurately transmit music to CI listeners. On the other hand, the finding might 
      not matter much if we assume that music, even in its less-than-optimal state, 
      functions for CI children, as for NH children, as a developmental jumpstarter, a 
      language-learning tool, a cognitive enricher, a motivator, and an attention 
      enhancer.

TI  - Forte Fortissimo for amateur musicians: no effect on otoacoustic emissions.
PG  - 3-8
AB  - Many amateur musicians are likely to be exposed to high sound levels during 
      rehearsals. Measuring otoacoustic emissions (OAE) is an objective technique to 
      assess hearing ability and can be used as an early predictor of hearing loss. 
      This study aimed to record sound levels at an amateur brass band rehearsal and to 
      examine the cochlear function of the musicians by evaluating distortion product 
      (DP) OAE amplitudes before and after sound exposure. Twenty-four brass band 
      musicians and 10 office workers were examined with personal noise measurements 
      and DPOAE tests before and after a music rehearsal or one office workday, 
      respectively. The sound levels in the brass band ranged from 92 to 100 dBA, LaEQ 
      96 dBA. However, the amateur brass band members had no change in DPOAEs after 
      this exposure compared to pre-exposure levels and compared to office workers.

TI  - Preferred and minimum acceptable listening levels for musicians while using floor 
      and in-ear monitors.
PG  - 147-59
LID - 10.1044/1092-4388(2008/011) [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This study examined the impact that changing on-stage music and crowd 
      noise levels during musical performance had on preferred listening levels (PLLs) 
      and minimum acceptable listening levels (MALLs) across both floor and in-ear 
      monitors. METHOD: Participants for this study were 23- to 48-year-old musicians, 
      with and without hearing loss, who had 10 years of musical training or comparable 
      professional experience. For this study, PLLs and MALLs were established for the 
      musician's own voice, whereas the levels of other onstage musical signals were 
      systematically varied. PLLs for in-ear monitors were found at significantly lower 
      levels than for floor monitors (approximately 0.6 dB). RESULTS: PLLs for in-ear 
      monitors were found at significantly lower levels than for floor monitors 
      (approximately 0.6 dB). However, despite large spectral differences, PLLs across 
      the 2 monitor types were small enough that the same recommended exposure time 
      would be advocated based on National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health 
      and Occupational Safety and Health Administration recommendations. MALL data also 
      indicated significantly lower levels (approximately 6.0 dB) when musicians were 
      using in-ear monitors in comparison to floor monitors. CONCLUSION: The much 
      larger difference suggests that musicians' risk of noise exposure may be reduced 
      by the use of in-ear monitors. However, given the similar PLL results and known 
      monitor output levels, proper counseling would likely be required before this 
      potential advantage would be realized.

PG  - 146-58
LID - 10.1177/1084713812471906 [doi]
AB  - Hearing instrument design focuses on the amplification of speech to reduce the 
      negative effects of hearing loss. Many amateur and professional musicians, along 
      with music enthusiasts, also require their hearing instruments to perform well 
      when listening to the frequent, high amplitude peaks of live music. One 
      limitation, in most current digital hearing instruments with 16-bit 
      analog-to-digital (A/D) converters, is that the compressor before the A/D 
      conversion is limited to 95 dB (SPL) or less at the input. This is more than 
      adequate for the dynamic range of speech; however, this does not accommodate the 
      amplitude peaks present in live music. The hearing instrument input compression 
      system can be adjusted to accommodate for the amplitudes present in music that 
      would otherwise be compressed before the A/D converter in the hearing instrument. 
      The methodology behind this technological approach will be presented along with 
      measurements to demonstrate its effectiveness.

TI  - The Effects of Monaural Stimulation on Frequency-Following Responses in Adults

PG  - e203-e210
LID - 10.1055/s-0043-1761167 [doi]
AB  - Introduction  Musicians have an advantage over non-musicians in detecting, 
      perceiving, and processing nonverbal (i.e., environmental sounds, tones and 
      others) and verbal sounds (i.e., consonant, vowel, phrases and others) as well as 
      instrumental sounds. In contrast to the high skill of musicians, there is another 
      group of people who are tone-deaf and have difficulty in distinguishing musical 
      sounds or singing in tune. These sounds can originate in different ways, such as 
      a musical instrument, orchestra, or the human voice. Objective  The objective of 
      the present work is to study frequency-following responses (FFRs) in individuals 
      who can sing in-tune and those who sing off-tune. Methods  Electrophysiological 
      responses were recorded in 37 individuals divided in two groups: (i) control 
      group (CG) with professional musicians, and (ii) experimental group (EG) with 
      non-musicians. Results  There was homogeneity between the two groups regarding 
      age and gender. The CG had more homogeneous responses in the latency of the FFRs 
      waves when responses between the right and left ears were compared to those of 
      the EG. Conclusion  This study showed that monaural stimulation (right or left) 
      in an FFR test is useful for demonstrating impairment of speech perception in 
      individuals who sing off tune. The response of the left ear appears to present 
      more subtlety and reliability when identifying the coding of speech sound in 
      individuals who sing off tune.

AB  - Good rehearsal facilities for musicians are essential. Directive 2003/10/EC 
      necessitates that musicians are protected from noise exposure. A code of conduct 
      gives the guidelines how this should be done. This study examines room acoustics 
      recommendations provided by the Finnish code of conduct, and discusses whether 
      they are adequate. Small teaching facilities were measured after renovation and 
      compared to earlier measurements. Teachers' opinions were inquired about the 
      facilities before and after. The renovation did not decrease the noise exposure 
      of the teachers. However, the majority preferred the facilities after the 
      renovation. The Finnish code of conduct is not sufficient for facilities where 
      loud instruments are played, or band practise. Good facilities can be designed 
      but they must be specified at the designing stage for their intended use.

TI  - General Health Status, Music Performance Anxiety, and Coping Methods of Musicians 
      Working in Turkish State Symphony Orchestras: A Cross-Sectional Study.
PG  - 118-123
LID - 10.21091/mppa.2018.2019 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: This study assessed the general health, music performance anxiety (MPA), 
      and coping methods of musicians working in six state orchestras in Turkey. 
      METHODS: All musicians working in the state symphony orchestras (n=384) were 
      invited to participate in the study. In face-to-face interviews, the authors 
      administered a questionnaire, which consisted of five sections: sociodemographic 
      information, history of musical performance, health status, general health 
      questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12), and MPA scale. Mann-Whitney U-test, Student's t-test, 
      and Spearman's correlation test were used to analyze the questionnaire data. 
      RESULTS: The 220 musicians who participated included 121 (55%) males and 99 (45%) 
      females, with a mean age of 42.4±11.3 yrs. For musculoskeletal symptoms, 87.6% 
      reported at least one symptom with the most common being pain. For general health 
      status, the GHQ-12 showed 64% of musicians were at low risk, 18.7% at moderate 
      risk, and 17.3% at high risk in terms of mental health. The prevalence of MPA 
      before or during performance was 81.8%, and 60% of musicians stated that 
      performance anxiety negatively affected their performances. CONCLUSIONS: Results 
      indicate that musicians working in Turkish state symphony orchestras encounter 
      numerous health problems (tinnitus, hearing loss, musculoskeletal symptoms, etc.) 
      due to their profession. No specific health support is provided, especially 
      education and health service provision.

TI  - Impairments in musical abilities reflected in the auditory brainstem: evidence 
      from congenital amusia.
PG  - 1644-50
LID - 10.1111/ejn.12931 [doi]
AB  - Congenital amusia is a neurogenetic condition, characterized by a deficit in 
      music perception and production, not explained by hearing loss, brain damage or 
      lack of exposure to music. Despite inferior musical performance, amusics exhibit 
      normal auditory cortical responses, with abnormal neural correlates suggested to 
      lie beyond auditory cortices. Here we show, using auditory brainstem responses to 
      complex sounds in humans, that fine-grained automatic processing of sounds is 
      impoverished in amusia. Compared with matched non-musician controls, spectral 
      amplitude was decreased in amusics for higher harmonic components of the auditory 
      brainstem response. We also found a delayed response to the early transient 
      aspects of the auditory stimulus in amusics. Neural measures of spectral 
      amplitude and response timing correlated with participants' behavioral 
      assessments of music processing. We demonstrate, for the first time, that amusia 
      affects how complex acoustic signals are processed in the auditory brainstem. 
      This neural signature of amusia mirrors what is observed in musicians, such that 
      the aspects of the auditory brainstem responses that are enhanced in musicians 
      are degraded in amusics. By showing that gradients of music abilities are 
      reflected in the auditory brainstem, our findings have implications not only for 
      current models of amusia but also for auditory functioning in general.

TI  - Subcortical and cortical correlates of pitch discrimination: Evidence for two 
      levels of neuroplasticity in musicians.

AB  - Musicians are highly trained to discriminate fine pitch changes but the neural 
      bases of this ability are poorly understood. It is unclear whether such 
      training-dependent differences in pitch processing arise already in the 
      subcortical auditory system or are linked to more central stages. To address this 
      question, we combined psychoacoustic testing with functional MRI to measure 
      cortical and subcortical responses in musicians and non-musicians during a 
      pitch-discrimination task. First, we estimated behavioral pitch-discrimination 
      thresholds for complex tones with harmonic components that were either resolved 
      or unresolved in the auditory system. Musicians outperformed non-musicians, 
      showing lower pitch-discrimination thresholds in both conditions. The same 
      participants underwent task-related functional MRI, while they performed a 
      similar pitch-discrimination task. To account for the between-group differences 
      in pitch-discrimination, task difficulty was adjusted to each individual's 
      pitch-discrimination ability. Relative to non-musicians, musicians showed 
      increased neural responses to complex tones with either resolved or unresolved 
      harmonics especially in right-hemispheric areas, comprising the right superior 
      temporal gyrus, Heschl's gyrus, insular cortex, inferior frontal gyrus, and in 
      the inferior colliculus. Both subcortical and cortical neural responses predicted 
      the individual pitch-discrimination performance. However, functional activity in 
      the inferior colliculus correlated with differences in pitch discrimination 
      across all participants, but not within the musicians group alone. Only neural 
      activity in the right auditory cortex scaled with the fine pitch-discrimination 
      thresholds within the musicians. These findings suggest two levels of 
      neuroplasticity in musicians, whereby training-dependent changes in pitch 
      processing arise at the collicular level and are preserved and further enhanced 
      in the right auditory cortex.

TI  - A pilot study of occupational injury and illness experienced by classical 
      musicians.
PG  - 19-24
AB  - Limited attention is paid to the hazards experienced by orchestra musicians in 
      the occupational health and safety literature. Within that literature, the 
      primary focus has been on noise exposure. A focus on this area is warranted 
      because high sound pressure levels are a product of this work environment. 
      However, in addition to being at risk for noise-induced hearing loss, workers are 
      also at risk for musculoskeletal injury and illness related to stressful body 
      postures held for prolonged work periods. The socio-political forces of 
      employment may place workers at risk for mental health disorders (e.g., 
      depression). The researchers distributed an anonymous survey to classical 
      orchestra musicians in the southwestern United States. The survey inventoried 
      several areas related to occupational health risks. Results suggest low health 
      care-seeking behaviors relative to self-reported signs and symptoms of morbidity. 
      Musicians also reported limited formal training and education regarding 
      occupational health risks. Risk information was provided late in their 
      professional development. This is a particular concern because of the young age 
      at which music training is initiated.

TI  - [Risk assessment of hearing loss in orchestral musicians].
PG  - 493-511
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to assess sound exposure and the risk of 
      noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) in orchestral musicians. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      Questionnaire inquiries and sound pressure level measurements were carried out in 
      63 musicians. Based on these data the risk assessment of the NIHL was performed 
      according to ISO 1999:1990 (PN-ISO 1999:1990). RESULTS: The classical orchestral 
      musicians are usually exposed to sound at equivalent continuous A-weighted sound 
      pressure levels of 81-90 dB (10-90th percentile), for 20-48 h (10-90th 
      percentile) per week. Occupational exposures to such sound levels over 40 years 
      of employment cause the risk of hearing impairment (expressed as mean hearing 
      threshold level for 2, 3 and 4 kHz equal or greater than 25 dB) in the range of 
      13-33% and 9-33% in females and males, respectively. The highest risk is related 
      to playing clarinet (up to 33%), tube (up to 34%), trumpet (up to 37%), trombone 
      (up to 40%), percussion section (up to 41%) and horn (up to 47%). About 46% of 
      respondents noticed hearing impairment. Nearly every fifth musician complained of 
      tinnitus while almost half (48%) of them--of hyperacusis. However, only 14% of 
      musicians declared present or past usage of hearing protective devices (HPDs) 
      while over twice of them (30%) intended to use HPDs in the future.

AB  - Temporary and permanent shifts in auditory thresholds were found in 43 hard rock 
      musicians and temporary shifts were also observed in some listeners. The 
      threshold shifts involved all of the conventional puretone test frequencies. 
      Custom-fitted polyvinyl chloride ear protectors were found to be effective in 
      prevention of these noise-induced hearing losses.

AB  - Hearing thresholds were determined in 83 'pop' musicians with an average age of 
      26 years, average exposure time of 9 years and average weekly exposure time of 18 
      hours. The following factors had a statistically significant influence (p 95) on 
      hearing: ageing, brief exposure per session, long exposure time in years (2 kHz), 
      participation in military service (250 Hz), listening to pop music with head 
      phones (2 kHz).

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The condition of teeth and function of the oral organs are 
      important when playing wind or brass instruments. Although there are some reports 
      on dental treatment for musicians, few studies have investigated their acoustic 
      performance following treatment. This report describes the prosthodontic 
      rehabilitation provided for an oboist who had lost a tooth as a result of trauma 
      and includes an evaluation of her subsequent musical performance using acoustic 
      analyzes. CASE DESCRIPTION: The patient was a 63-year-old professional oboe 
      player who fractured the upper and lower alveolar bone and avulsed the upper 
      right central incisor during a fall due to epileptic seizure. While the alveolar 
      fracture was healing, she sought maxillofacial rehabilitation for the missing 
      tooth to maintain her ability to play the oboe. Her rehabilitation consisted of a 
      provisional removable prosthesis with an acrylic base and clasps followed by a 
      fixed implant prosthesis. A recording of her musical performance was objectively 
      analyzed at each stage of treatment. Rhythm analysis confirmed the stability of 
      notes played rapidly. Her performance dynamics were analyzed by psychoacoustic 
      measurements. Her satisfaction with the prosthesis was assessed by a 
      self-reported questionnaire. The results of the acoustic evaluation helped to 
      adjust the provisional prosthesis so that it was suitable for playing the oboe 
      and the final prosthesis was designed accordingly. CONCLUSION: Prosthetic dental 
      treatment for this patient included both subjective and objective evaluations 
      that helped to ensure that she could continue playing the oboe at her previous 
      performance level.

PG  - 4233-5
AB  - Only few studies have investigated the frequency of hearing disorders in rock 
      musicians. Performing rock music is apparently associated with a hearing loss in 
      a fraction of musicians. Tinnitus and hyperacusis are more common among rock 
      musicians than among the background population. It seems as if some sort of 
      resistance against further hearing loss is developed over time. The use of ear 
      protection devices have not been studied systematically but appears to be 
      associated with diminished hearing loss.

AB  - Ludwig van Beethoven is nowadays considered to be one of the greatest composers 
      in the history of music and his myth-like reputation is enhanced by his deafness; 
      however, deafness was not the only condition which affected his genius. Due to 
      the many lamentations contained in his letters about continuously recurring 
      health problems, various attempts at an interpretation of Beethoven's personality 
      have been undertaken. These included psychoanalytical considerations with respect 
      to his father-mother relationship and also diagnostic attempts with reference to 
      the symptoms of a possible borderline personality syndrome. The aim of this 
      article is to comprehensively analyze the diseases of the patient Beethoven from 
      the perspective of specialized medical disciplines based on new research results, 
      to summarize various discipline-specific considerations and to make a 
      contemporary assessment from the viewpoint of current scientific results.

TI  - Temporary threshold shift after exposure to pop music.
PG  - 127-35
AB  - Temporary threshold shift (TTS) was studied in pop musicians as well as in 
      listeners. It appears that TTS is less pronounced in pop musicians than in 
      listeners. This can only in part be explained by slightly inferior hearing 
      threshold levels than in the audience before exposure. Further, male listeners 
      showed more TTS than female listeners. After 2 hours of exposure to live pop 
      music a TTS2 appears in pop musicians after an exposure to 98 dB(A) as opposed to 
      listeners where TTS2 appears at 92 dB(A). When the present results are related to 
      the CHABA risk criteria it seems that exposure to live pop music at 100 dB(A) for 
      2 hours is a limit which should not be exceeded if the risk of permanent hearing 
      loss is to be avoided.

TI  - [Study of the hearing of rock and roll musicians].
PG  - 49-54
AB  - BACKGROUND: rock and roll has as one of its main characteristics the excessive 
      sound pressure levels. Several studies have demonstrated that the sound levels of 
      rock concerts can range from 100 to 115dB (A), with peak levels of 150dB (A). 
      AIM: to study the hearing of rock and roll musicians, analyzing the results of 
      the audiological evaluation and verifying the influence of time of exposure to 
      amplified music. METHOD: a questionnaire was answered by 23 rock and roll 
      musicians (46 ears) who were also evaluated by means of pure tone audiometry, 
      immitance audiometry and transient/distortion product evoked otoacoustic 
      emissions (OAET and OAEPD). RESULTS: regarding the time of exposure to music, 
      values close to the limit of acceptance (tending to be significants) were found 
      in the frequencies of 0.5 and 6kHz, in the pure tone audiometry. A statistically 
      significant difference was also found in the OAET test in the frequency of 2kHz 
      and also in the frequencies of 0.75, 1, 4 and 6kHz in the OAEPD test. CONCLUSION: 
      the results indicate that although hearing loss was not found in the studied 
      population, alteration in the register of the OAE already exists, suggesting 
      alteration of the cochlear function. Regarding time of exposure, the results 
      indicate that musicians with more than 10 years of practice present statistically 
      significant differences when compared to those with less time of exposure.

TI  - Why orchestral musicians are bound to wear earplugs: About the ineffectiveness of 
      physical measures to reduce sound exposure.
PG  - 3154
LID - 10.1121/1.5012689 [doi]
AB  - Symphony orchestra musicians are exposed to noise levels that put them at risk of 
      developing hearing damage. This study evaluates the potential effectivity of 
      common control measures used in orchestras on open stages with a typical 
      symphonic setup. A validated acoustic prediction model is used that calculates 
      binaural sound exposure levels at the ears of all musicians in the orchestra. The 
      model calculates the equivalent sound levels for a performance of the first 2 min 
      of the 4th movement of Mahler's 1st symphony, which can be considered 
      representative for loud orchestral music. Calculated results indicate that 
      risers, available space, and screens at typical positions do not significantly 
      influence sound exposure. A hypothetical scenario with surround screens shows 
      that, even when shielding all direct sound from others, sound exposure is reduced 
      moderately with the largest effect on players in loud sections. In contrast, a 
      dramatic change in room acoustic conditions only leads to considerable reductions 
      for soft players. It can be concluded that significant reductions are only 
      reached with extreme measures that are unrealistic. It seems impossible for the 
      studied physical measures to be effective enough to replace hearing protection 
      devices such as ear plugs.

TI  - [Orofacial and hearing specific problems among 340 wind instrumentalists in 
      Lebanon].
PG  - 159-67
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study is to detect the problems related to wind 
      instruments in order to determine the contributing factors. MATERIAL AND METHOD: 
      This study is a prospective study of a sample of Lebanese wind-instruments 
      musicians. Questionnaire of 17 items about personal data, musical activities in 
      general and specific problems related to wind instruments. RESULTS: 340 response 
      out of 400 (85%). Gender: male 100%. Age: 28.5 +/- 6.5 years (13-50). Practice of 
      any physical activity: 57.5%. Smokers: 40.5% Data about musical practice - Years 
      of practice: 6.5 +/- 5.5. Daily practice: 2.5 +/- 1.5 hours with 3.5 +/- 2 rest 
      periods of 16.5 +/- 15 minutes. Weekly practice: 5 +/- 2 days. Data about medical 
      problems - Hear loss 34%; respiratory difficulties: 19.5%; wound of lips muscles: 
      5%; gums and tongue lesions: 7.8%; myospasms of the cheeks and lips: 34.5%; 
      dental problems: 30.7%; temporo-mandibular disorders (TMD): 22.5%. There is a 
      high association between risk factors and pathology. Risks related to the 
      instrument's use : hear loss (p = 0.001), traumas to lips muscles (p = 0.065), 
      myospasms (p = 0.064), TMD (p = 0.000). Other factors: physical activity is 
      beneficial; smoking is harmful (breathing difficulties, spasms, headaches). 
      Factors influencing the different problems: age (31 +/- 7 years); years of 
      practice (9 +/- 6); hours of practice per day (2 +/- 1.5); days of practice per 
      week (4.5 +/- 2.5). CONCLUSION: Wind instruments are related to problems of 
      mouth, facial muscles and hearing. This may lead musicians to stop their 
      activities or to irreversible professional disabilities. A medical follow-up 
      during the musicians training is needed to prevent these problems.

TI  - An assessment of threshold shifts in nonprofessional pop/rock musicians using 
      conventional and extended high-frequency audiometry.
PG  - 643-8
AB  - The clinical value of extended high-frequency audiometry for the detection of 
      noise-induced hearing loss has not been established conclusively. The purpose of 
      this study was to assess the relative temporary threshold shift (TTS) in two 
      frequency regions (conventional versus extended high frequency). In this 
      exploratory study, pure-tone thresholds from 0.5 to 14 kHz were measured in both 
      ears of 16 nonprofessional pop/rock musicians (mean age, 35 yr; range, 27 to 49 
      yr), before and after a 90-minute rehearsal session. All had experienced repeated 
      exposures to intense sound levels during at least 5 yr of their musical careers. 
      After the rehearsal, median threshold levels were found to be significantly 
      poorer for frequencies from 0.5 to 8 kHz (Wilcoxon signed rank test, p <or= 
      0.004) but were unchanged in the extended high-frequency range from 9 to 14 kHz. 
      Decreases in the median threshold values measured before the rehearsal were 
      present across the conventional frequency range, most notably at 6 kHz, but were 
      not observed in the extended high-frequency range. On the basis of these results, 
      extended high-frequency audiometry does not seem advantageous as a means of the 
      early detection of noise-induced hearing loss.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The ability to separate two interleaved melodies is an important 
      factor in music appreciation. This ability is greatly reduced in people with 
      hearing impairment, contributing to difficulties in music appreciation. The aim 
      of this study was to assess whether visual cues, musical training or musical 
      context could have an effect on this ability, and potentially improve music 
      appreciation for the hearing impaired. METHODS: Musicians (N = 18) and 
      non-musicians (N = 19) were asked to rate the difficulty of segregating a 
      four-note repeating melody from interleaved random distracter notes. Visual cues 
      were provided on half the blocks, and two musical contexts were tested, with the 
      overlap between melody and distracter notes either gradually increasing or 
      decreasing. CONCLUSIONS: Visual cues, musical training, and musical context all 
      affected the difficulty of extracting the melody from a background of interleaved 
      random distracter notes. Visual cues were effective in reducing the difficulty of 
      segregating the melody from distracter notes, even in individuals with no musical 
      training. These results are consistent with theories that indicate an important 
      role for central (top-down) processes in auditory streaming mechanisms, and 
      suggest that visual cues may help the hearing-impaired enjoy music.

AB  - Tinnitus is an auditory perception in the absence of any external sound source. 
      It has been suggested that tinnitus is related to enhanced synchronization of 
      neuronal activity in the auditory cortex. Usually a hearing damage can be 
      identified suggesting auditory deprivation to central auditory regions to be 
      fundamental for neurophysiological processes related to tinnitus. Until now, 
      human research has been conducted on patients with chronic tinnitus (>6 months). 
      However, neuronal activity accompanying auditory deprivation and putatively 
      tinnitus may not remain constant over time, making it difficult to directly 
      relate outcomes of current animal studies (acute tinnitus) to chronic tinnitus in 
      humans, and vice versa. We investigated 14 amateur rock musicians who frequently 
      reported a short-term tinnitus immediately after band practice. 
      Magnetoencephalographic resting-state recordings, audiometry and tinnitus testing 
      were performed at two separate occasions: with and without previous exposure to 
      loud music. Analyses revealed that transient tinnitus was accompanied by 
      temporary hearing loss in both ears and increased gamma activity in the right 
      auditory cortex in 13 out of 14 cases. Additionally, tinnitus frequency was 
      strongly correlated to hearing loss. Analogous to animal studies, our results 
      show for the first time in humans that noise trauma leads rapidly to increased 
      neuronal synchrony in the auditory cortex. Importantly, the strongly 
      right-lateralized effect implies that it does not reflect tinnitus percept per 
      se. This could rather have been triggered by greater discontinuities of hearing 
      loss at high frequencies that were particularly pronounced in the left ear.

TI  - [Peripheral vestibular syndrome intricated pathogenic issues. A case report].
PG  - 143-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ménière's syndrome appears to be the final common pathway of the 
      mechanisms the inner ear responds to almost any injury. Although the autoimmune 
      disease seems to play a major role, exposure to intense noise can also be a 
      trigger in the appearance and/or aggravation of the disease. MATERIAL AND 
      METHODS: The case of 41 years old musician with a history of ankylosing 
      spondylitis, diagnosed with Ménière's syndrome 5 years ago, is presented. 
      Recently the symptoms became more polymorphic, revealing the association between 
      benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), Ménière's syndrome and high 
      frequency hearing loss in an autoimmune background. Besides general, neurological 
      and ENT examination, the diagnostic workup comprised of tonal audiogram, brain 
      stem auditory evoked potentials, computerized dynamic posturography and 
      videonistagmography. RESULTS: The final diagnosis was acute noise trauma, 
      Ménière's syndrome, left horizontal semicircular canal BPPV, bilateral 
      sensorineural sudden aggravated hearing loss in high frequencies (above 9 kHz) 
      and allegedly autoimmune inner ear disease. Treatment with an association of 
      corticosteroids, vasodilators and vitamins combined with Vannucchi's maneuver 
      were followed by a significant relief of the symptoms. CONCLUSION: Although no 
      causal relationship was found between acoustic trauma and increased endolymphatic 
      pressure, both literature data and the case presented show that intense and 
      prolonged noise exposure may aggravate peripheral vestibular syndrome.

TI  - [Prevention of noise induced hearing loss in musicians of Chinese opera].
PG  - 73-5, 124
AB  - The incidence of hearing impairment in musicians of Chinese opera is higher than 
      that in popular music and rock and roll music. The sound levels of different 
      instruments used in Chinese opera measured acoustically showed drums, gongs and 
      cymbols to be hazardous to the ear. The conventional measures of prevention, such 
      as ear plugs are not acceptable by the musicians because of interference to the 
      musician's hearing ability. A rearrangement of situations of the musicians was 
      suggested by the authors. The percussive musicians should be situated one meter 
      lower than other musicians. Animal (guinea pigs) experiments by study of AP in 
      EcochG and ultrastructural observations of the cochlea have confirmed that our 
      suggestion for prevention of noise induced hearing impairment to be efficient.

TI  - Preservation of rhythmic clocking in cochlear implant users: a study of 
      isochronous versus anisochronous beat detection.
PG  - 164-9
LID - 10.1177/1084713810387937 [doi]
AB  - The capacity for internal rhythmic clocking involves a relationship between 
      perceived auditory input and subsequent cognitive processing by which isochronous 
      auditory stimuli induce a temporal beat expectancy in a listener. Although rhythm 
      perception has previously been examined in cochlear implant (CI) users through 
      various tasks based primarily on rhythm pattern identification, such tasks may 
      not have been sufficiently nuanced to detect defects in internal rhythmic 
      clocking, which requires temporal integration on a scale of milliseconds. The 
      present study investigated the preservation of such rhythmic clocking in CI 
      participants through a task requiring detection of isochronicity in the final 
      beat of a four-beat series presented at different tempos. Our results show that 
      CI users performed comparably to normal hearing (NH) participants in all 
      isochronous rhythm detection tasks but that professionally trained musicians 
      (MUS) significantly outperformed both NH and CI participants. These results 
      suggest that CI users have intact rhythm perception even on a temporally 
      demanding task that requires tight preservation of timing differences between a 
      series of auditory events. Also, these results suggest that musical training 
      might improve rhythmic clocking in CI users beyond normal hearing levels, which 
      may be useful in light of the deficits in spectral processing commonly observed 
      in CI users.

TI  - Evaluation and treatment of severe hyperacusis.
PG  - 295-9
AB  - A 52-year-old male was evaluated by the authors after initially reporting 
      fullness in his left ear while traveling on an airplane. A unique feature of the 
      patient's complaint was the development of severe bilateral hyperacusis (loudness 
      discomfort levels of between 20-34 dB HL) in spite of the fact that the hearing 
      loss was initially reported in the left ear. To achieve loudness comfort, the 
      patient was initially fit with ER-25 musician earplugs that proved to be 
      unsuccessful. The patient next purchased earplugs and earmuffs from a gun shop in 
      order to obtain relief from the pain and discomfort caused by his exposure to 
      everyday environmental sounds. This paper describes the use of hearing devices 
      that proved to be effective in providing attenuation sufficient that the patient 
      rarely needs to rely on earplugs and earmuffs for relief from his hyperacusis.

TI  - Beyond music: auditory temporary threshold shift in rock musicians after a heavy 
      metal concert.
PG  - 617-9
AB  - Audiometry was undertaken before and within half an hour following a heavy metal 
      concert to assess evidence of noise damage. Of the four members tested, one 
      member wore an ear defender in his right ear during the period of noise exposure. 
      All unprotected ears showed a temporary threshold shift which was maximum in the 
      lower frequencies. There was some evidence that early noise damage had occurred 
      with a dip at 6 kHz. The role of music as noise and its potential to damage the 
      cochlea are discussed.

AB  - Pitch perception modifications are among the little-known adverse effects 
      observed with antiepileptics, mainly affecting patients treated with 
      carbamazepine (CBZ). Here, we describe an original French case of pitch 
      perception modification due to CBZ resulting in perfect pitch loss. We also 
      reviewed the literature as well as French and world health organisation global 
      pharmacovigilance database. The case report concerns a 22-year-old patient with 
      perfect pitch with untreated left temporal partial epilepsy. Following a 
      generalized seizure, the introduction of CBZ prolonged release (200mg twice a 
      day) is decided. As soon as CBZ is introduced, the patient notices a change in 
      pitch perception, about a semitone lower. This adverse effect persisted despite a 
      gradual decrease in doses. The patient reported a total recovery of his perfect 
      pitch when CBZ stopped completely 11 years later. In the French pharmacovigilance 
      database, only one other case of pitch perception modification under CBZ was 
      recorded (no cases were found with oxcarbazepine, lacosamide, sodium valproate, 
      lamotrigine, levetiracetam, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone, ethosuximide, 
      vigabatrine, felbamate, gabapentin, tiagabine and topiramate). In the literature, 
      27 cases of pitch perception modification have been published with CBZ, 1 case 
      with oxcarbazepine and 1 case with lacosamide. Pitch perception modification is a 
      very rare adverse effect of CBZ, oxcarbazepine and lacosamide, identified in the 
      literature mainly in the Japanese population, in experienced musicians. A rapid 
      onset after the introduction of treatment, a complete resolution of symptoms, in 
      most cases upon discontinuation of treatment, is observed, with no sequelae 
      reported. Due to the impact on quality of life, especially in patients whose 
      profession is related to music, knowledge of this adverse event seems important 
      to evoke this diagnosis.

TI  - Does pop music cause hearing damage?
PG  - 432-7
AB  - Relatively few investigations have so far reported on the hearing in pop 
      musicians. In summary, these have shown a sensorineural hearing loss in 5%. This 
      study was carried out on 83 professionals working with pop music. Depending upon 
      how hearing loss is defined, we found a sensorineural loss in 13-30% of the pop 
      musicians. Hearing losses were slight. It appears that the risk for hearing 
      damage for the audience is small. A limit for presentation of the music at 95 dB 
      (A) is suggested as a compromise satisfying both audiologists and audience.

TI  - [The objective frequency decrement test (OFDT): a new objective EEG-test for 
      determination of the difference limen for frequencies (author's transl)].
PG  - 1025-33
AB  - Subjective methods measuring the difference limen for frequencies (DLF) take a 
      lot of time and are not reliable. You can find this fact not only while testing 
      normal subjects, but also while testing patients with hearing loss combined with 
      tinnitus. Therefore this new objective DLF-test has been developed. Apart from 
      the testing function for clinical purpose, the different results of other studies 
      can also be controlled. After 1080 msec a pure tone is changed to a lower 
      frequency for a period of 670 msec. Immediately after the tone is finished a 
      picture is presented. As a control pure tones of unvarying pitch are offered. 
      This stimulus sequence is repeated for several times. The expectancies to the 
      change of pitch and to the picture produce a negative slow potential shift 
      (Walter's CNV) in the EEG. The perception of frequency change yields to a late 
      evoked potential and to a DC-shift; as a result of the optimum conditions of the 
      expectancy-situation and the appropriate recording-technique only 5-10 sweeps 
      must be summed up to obtain a potential, sometimes it even can be seen in the 
      "raw-EEG". The test makes a differentiation between a just believed and a real 
      perception possible. A sample of subjects with normal hearing and a subgroup 
      (musicians) were selected for the standardization. Because of objectivity, 
      reliability and economy the test can be used for clinical application.

TI  - [Noise--a stress factor in occupational and other environments].
PG  - 1-31
AB  - The effects of noise on health can be divided into aural effects and extraaural 
      effects. The following review describes - after some historical remarks - first 
      the physical and technical basis of noise analysis. The definition of "equivalent 
      continuous sound level" (Lm) and "rating sound level" (Lr) is given. Extraaural 
      noise effects mainly come from the environment (traffic noise, construction noise 
      on building sites). One must distinguish physical and vegetative reactions. An 
      important extraaural effect is the disturbance of sleep. The objectivation and 
      quantification of extraaural effects of noise on health is very difficult because 
      there exist a lot of disturbing factors. The most important aural effect of noise 
      on health is the occupational hearing loss. To assess these effects, information 
      about physiology, pathophysiology and clinical indications of noise induced 
      labyrinthine deafness is necessary. As examples results of investigations into 
      the effect of noise on arc welders, professional musicians and building workers 
      are presented. Generation of noise should be minimised by technical methods, 
      exposure to noise by personal protection. The methods for occupational medical 
      check-up of the employment accident insurance fund are specially mentioned. The 
      results of these preventive procedures can be seen in the decreasing numbers of 
      occupational hearing loss.

TI  - [In situ sound pressure measurement in a professional violinist with bilateral 
      tinnitus].
PG  - 514-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: A case of a professional violinist suffering from a bilateral 
      tinnitus is presented. The musician reported the tinnitus to be louder and more 
      straining when playing his Vuillaume violin (France 1840) as compared with his 
      Carcassi violin (Italy 1763). CASE REPORT: In the 42-year-old musician, 
      audiometry revealed a normal hearing threshold in the right ear and a slight 
      hearing loss in the left ear of up to 20 dB between 2 kHz and 8 kHz. Transitory 
      evoked otoacoustic emissions could only be measured in the right ear. The 
      tinnitus could be masked (distance type); residual inhibition was only seen in 
      the right ear. By sound intensity measurements in both external auditory canals, 
      the different sound spectra of both violins could be demonstrated. When playing 
      with "forte" intensity, sound pressure reached peaks of over 90 dB. The tinnitus 
      was ameliorated by lidocaine infusions. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The different 
      sound spectra of both violins may be the reason for the enhancement of the 
      musician's tinnitus. Interference of air and bone-conducted sound could lead to a 
      cochlear overlap and thus influence the tinnitus although such a phenomenon can 
      not be verified. It was previously reported that high-pitched instruments may 
      cause tinnitus sensations in performing musicians. A review of the literature 
      surprisingly reveals that although professional musicians are exposed to sound 
      pressure levels that may cause hearing impairment, only very few do develop one. 
      This fact has to be taken into account whenever an occupational disease is 
      suspected.

      belonging to a Republican Guard brass band, and give their interpretation of 
      abnormal findings, as they compare percussion with wind instruments and make 
      reference to literature data. Accompanying signs, such as ear fatigue, noise 
      intolerance, tinnitus, ear-aches, disturbance of sleep, psychic disorders, and 
      disturbances of equilibrium are also taken into account as predisposing factors. 
      Lastly, an attempt is made to bring out some of the characteristics that are 
      specific to each instrument.
