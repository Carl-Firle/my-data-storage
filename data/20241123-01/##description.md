# This is the repository for the data evaluation files of <br><br> `Aerosol emission rates from breathing, speaking, and speaking with a surgical mask`
## https://doi.org/

The Wolfram Mathematica files are created with the Version 13.0.1.
The order is prescribed by the starting index number.

+ __01_WallLossCorrection__ = evaluates the effect of wall loss absorption (will be neglected in proceeding process due to minor error variance)
+ __02_Aerosol 0180__ = task plots for particle emission rate
+ __03_Aerosol 0112__ = export of all task and correlation plots (no wall loss correction)
+ __04_EmissionRates 0006 ... 0008__ = Likelihood analysis and lognormal fit
