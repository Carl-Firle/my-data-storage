+ __20250731-01_baseline_leakage-24h__ = test of the air cleaners. After reaching baseline values, all air cleaners are stopped and the aerosol concentration in cabin, airlock and laboratory are recorded for 24 hours.
+ __20250814-01_dilution_leakage_01__ = all doors are closed and the air cleaners in airlock and laboratory are on. In cabin is normal ambient aerosol. The air in cabin is beeing washed out (dilution effect).
+ __20250814-02_dilution_leakage_02__ = all doors are closed. All air cleaners are running until baseline is reached. then, air cleaner in cabin is stopped. The other two are running. How constant is the baseline in cabin, i.e., how high is the dilution from leakage?
