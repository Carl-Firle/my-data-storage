N2  - Background: The evoked auditory brainstem response (EABR) is an objective electrophysiological test used to assess the brainstem’s auditory neural activity. Speech ABR (s-ABR) testing using verbal stimuli gives more important details about how the brainstem processes speech inputs which enables the detection of auditory processing impairments that do not manifest in click-provoked ABR. The use of speech syllables in the s-ABR reveals an important brainstem function that plays a crucial part in reading development and phonologic achievement which is an assessment of speech syllables. The syllable /da/ is often utilized in s-ABR measurement being a global syllable that can be tested in many nations with effective experimental confidence. Conclusion: The speech ABR is an objective, unbiased, quick test. It can be used to differentiate between many conditions such as auditory processing disorders (APD), specific language impairment (SLI), and children with academic challenges.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Musicians who wear hearing aids are a unique subset of hearing-impaired individuals. There are a number of issues musicians experience with hearing aids, making effective hearing rehabilitation a challenge. Research suggests hearing aid satisfaction in musicians is lower partly due to their advanced listening skills, however, qualitative research addressing musicians who wear hearing aids for music is scarce. The current study aimed to record the barriers encountered by musicians who wear hearing aids when playing their instrument/singing, listening to recorded music and listening to live music. DESIGN: Professional musicians who wear hearing aids were interviewed. Participants were questioned about their experiences with hearing loss and hearing aids, with particular emphasis on experiences listening to recorded and live music, and playing or performing music with the hearing aids. STUDY SAMPLE: Eight professional musicians were interviewed, using a semi-structured interview style, with a question and prompt guide. RESULTS: Thematic analysis revealed three main themes in the data: the musicians' journey, communication, and flexibility/adjustability. CONCLUSIONS: The results have implications for future research into specific fitting parameters for hearing aids for musicians (particularly for music performance), the need for evidence-based rehabilitation programs for musicians with hearing loss, and the need for a glossary of terms to assist communication between Audiologists and musicians.

N2  - Musicians are at risk of hearing loss and tinnitus due to regular exposure to high levels of noise. This level of risk may have been underestimated previously since damage to the auditory system, such as cochlear synaptopathy, may not be easily detectable using standard clinical measures. Most previous research investigating hearing loss in musicians has involved cross-sectional study designs that may capture only a snapshot of hearing health in relation to noise exposure. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of cumulative noise exposure on behavioural, electrophysiological, and self-report indices of hearing damage in early-career musicians and non-musicians with normal hearing over a 2-year period. Participants completed an annual test battery consisting of pure tone audiometry, extended high-frequency hearing thresholds, distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs), speech perception in noise, auditory brainstem responses, and self-report measures of tinnitus, hyperacusis, and hearing in background noise. Participants also completed the Noise Exposure Structured Interview to estimate cumulative noise exposure across the study period. Linear mixed models assessed changes over time. The longitudinal analysis comprised 64 early-career musicians (female n = 34; age range at T0 = 18–26 years) and 30 non-musicians (female n = 20; age range at T0 = 18–27 years). There were few longitudinal changes as a result of musicianship. Small improvements over time in some measures may be attributable to a practice/test-retest effect. Some measures (e.g., DPOAE indices of outer hair cell function) were associated with noise exposure at each time point, but did not show a significant change over time. A small proportion of participants reported a worsening of their tinnitus symptoms, which participants attributed to noise exposure, or not using hearing protection. Future longitudinal studies should attempt to capture the effects of noise exposure over a longer period, taken at several time points, for a precise measure of how hearing changes over time. Hearing conservation programmes for “at risk” individuals should closely monitor DPOAEs to detect early signs of noise-induced hearing loss when audiometric thresholds are clinically normal.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The role of patients in healthcare research is slowly evolving, although patient roles in the research process are limited. This paper reports on a patient-led research project aiming to develop a musical hearing training programme for patients with a cochlear implant (CI): the Musi-CI programme. A CI is an inner ear prosthesis that allows people with severe hearing loss to hear. However, while speech can be understood, CI users cannot fully enjoy music or feel aversion to it. The Musi-CI programme aims to reduce this music aversion to ultimately improve music enjoyment and social participation. The development of the Musi-CI programme was supported by a consortium of professionals in CI rehabilitation and research. The aim of this paper is to describe and evaluate the Musi-CI programme development process and its impact on professional CI rehabilitation and research. METHODS: Programme development was described using a 3-layered process model of action research, distinguishing the CI user process, the healthcare professional process and the research process. To evaluate perceptions on the programme development process, consortium partners provided written comments and participated in a reflexive evaluation session that was video-recorded. Reflexive evaluation aims for collective learning and strengthening collaboration among participants. Written comments and video data were analysed using template analysis. RESULTS: The involvement of an expert by experience was perceived as challenging but rewarding for all consortium partners, opening up new perspectives on CI-rehabilitation practice and research. Data analysis revealed two themes on the programme development process, professional space and acknowledgement, and two themes on the outcomes on CI rehabilitation and research: critical reflection and paradigm shift. CONCLUSION: Experts by experience represent a different knowledge domain that may contribute to change in rehabilitation and research. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: The development of the programme was initiated by a professional musician and CI user who organized the funding, had a leading role throughout the research process, including the write-up of the results, and co-authored this paper.

N2  - The most prevalent sensory impairment impacting the elderly is age-related hearing loss (HL), which affects around 65% of individuals over the age of 60 years. This bilateral, symmetrical sensorineural impairment profoundly affects auditory perception, speech discrimination, and the overall understanding of auditory signals. Influenced by diverse factors, age-related HL can substantially influence an individual’s quality of life and mental health and can lead to depression. Cochlear implantation (CI) stands as a standard intervention, yet despite advancements, music perception challenges persist, which can be addressed with individualized music therapy. This case report describes the journey of an 81-year-old musician through profound sensorineural hearing loss, cochlear implantation, and rehabilitative music therapy. Auditory evaluations, musical exercises, and quality of life assessments highlighted meaningful improvements in music perception, auditory skills, and overall satisfaction post-implantation. Music therapy facilitated emotional, functional, and musical levels of engagement, notably enhancing his ability to perceive melody, rhythm, and different instruments. Moreover, subjective assessments and audiograms indicated marked improvements in auditory differentiation, music enjoyment, and overall hearing thresholds. This comprehensive approach integrating bilateral CIs and music therapy showcased audiological and quality of life enhancements in an elderly individual with profound hearing loss, emphasizing the efficacy of this combined treatment approach.

N2  - Olfaction, the sense of smell, is under recognised and underappreciated despite being vital in wellbeing. It confers a major influence on the feeding process being the major contributor of flavour and has a direct involvement in the cephalic phase responses. Along with its influence on food and nutrition, olfaction is directly associated with cognitive function and impacts social communication and safety(1). Loss of olfactory acuity, commonly occurring in aging and frailty, significantly influences dietary behaviour and food selection(2). Unlike the senses of vision and audition, interventions are lacking. We propose in a proof-of-concept that cross modal integration of olfaction and audition could inhibit olfactory decline in lifelong musicians through encouraging neuroplasticity of the olfactory brain centres. Ethical approval was obtained from The University of Adelaide Human Research Ethics Committee. Male musicians with a lifetime experience of music (ME) and naïve non-musicians (NM) aged 55 years and over were recruited through music organisations and controls through the Australian Men's Shed network. The initial target sample size was twenty per cohort. Olfactory acuity was assessed with Sniffin' sticks® (Odofin, Groningen, The Netherlands), a well validated system of a battery of three tests regimes. Sniffin' sticks represent 'felt tipped pens' impregnated with odourants presented 20mm below the nose of participants who were then prompted to 'sniff'. Assays determined participant 'Threshold', 'Discrimination' and 'Identification' of test odours (3). Measurement of Threshold and Discrimination were undertaken in triplet fifteen seconds apart with eyes closed; measurement of Threshold being conducted in an ascending 'staircase' to detect lowest odour concentration detectable, whereas measurement of Discrimination selected the 'odd-manout' of a triplet comprising two identical and one different odour. Measurement of Identification, with eyes open, selected the odour of a single 'pen' from a prompt list of four. All tests demanded selection. Each of the test batteries were scored out of sixteen along with total aggregate of Threshold, Discrimination, and Identification (TDI). Twenty-six participants completed the study (18 ME and 8 NM); numbers were limited owing to active COVID-19. Mean and standard deviations (SD) of Threshold, Discrimination, Identification and TDI were derived and compared between groups using 't'-test. For ME, Threshold, Discrimination, and Identification values were 6.2 (SD ± 3.7), 10.6 (SD ± 1.9), and 12.9 (SD ± 1.6). The respective values for NM were 5.0 (SD ± 2.3), 8.8(SD ± 2.9), and 10.8 (SD ± 2.5). The ME group showed a significantly higher Discrimination (p = 0.164). Significant differences were not seen for Threshold, Identification, and overall TDI scores, however the small sample size may have accounted for this. Based on this proof-of-concept, further exploration of music is warranted as an intervention to enhance olfactory acuity to potentially improve the intake of food and nutrition, and enrich pleasure of eating and drinking, and quality of life.

N2  - Objective: To review a rarely identified acute presentation of right middle cerebral artery (MCA) ischemic stroke causing receptive amusia. Background: Historically, receptive amusia refers to a pathologic inability to distinguish melodies, timbre, and pitch, which may result in ensembles of acoustic sounds being perceived as discordant. Though rarely appreciated in clinical evaluation of stroke patients, voxel-based symptom lesion mapping (VSLM) studies show that acquired amusia in stroke is specifically associated with infarcts in the superior temporal gyrus, Heschl's gyrus, insula, and striatum of the right hemisphere. Design/Methods: Case report Results: A 62-year-old male with right bundle branch block and moderate mitral valve regurgitation presented to the emergency department with a vague transient binocular visual disturbance, followed by two days of difficulty with the auditory processing of music, first noticed while playing the drums. There was no difficulty with physically playing the drums, coordinating his movements, or reading sheet music, however he could not process harmonies or stay synchronized with his bandmates. No deficits on neurologic exam. MRI brain without contrast showed a late acute right inferior division MCA territory infarct involving the parietal, temporal, and posterior insular regions. Vessel imaging showed no significant stenosis or large vessel occlusion. Further workup revealed a large patent foramen ovale (PFO) and an episode of atrial ibrillation. One month later, the patient still had difficulty processing music and also endorsed that environmental sounds were bothersome to him. Conclusions: We report a case of a musician presenting with isolated receptive amusia in the setting of an acute embolic right MCA stroke. We suggest that this subtle sign is under-recognized as a possible presentation of cortical infarct in this territory, especially in non-musically inclined patients, and careful assessment for amusia could facilitate the appropriate diagnosis and management of stroke patients with infarcts in the right hemisphere.

N2  - Sentence repetition has been the focus of extensive psycholinguistic research. The notion that music training can bolster speech perception in adverse auditory conditions has been met with mixed results. In this work, we sought to gauge the effect of babble noise on immediate repetition of spoken and sung phrases of varying semantic content (expository, narrative, and anomalous), initially in 100 English-speaking monolinguals with and without music training. The two cohorts also completed some non-musical cognitive tests and the Montreal Battery of Evaluation of Amusia (MBEA). When disregarding MBEA results, musicians were found to significantly outperform non-musicians in terms of overall repetition accuracy. Sung targets were recalled significantly better than spoken ones across groups in the presence of babble noise. Sung expository targets were recalled better than spoken expository ones, and semantically anomalous content was recalled more poorly in noise. Rerunning the analysis after eliminating thirteen participants who were diagnosed with amusia showed no significant group differences. This suggests that the notion of enhanced speech perception—in noise or otherwise—in musicians needs to be evaluated with caution. Musicianship aside, this study showed for the first time that sung targets presented in babble noise seem to be recalled better than spoken ones. We discuss the present design and the methodological approach of screening for amusia as factors which may partially account for some of the mixed results in the field.

N2  - Otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) are a non-invasive metric of cochlear function. Studies of OAEs in musicians have yielded mixed results, ranging from evidence of diminished OAEs in musicians—suggesting noise-induced hearing loss—to no difference when compared to non-musicians, or even a trend for stronger OAEs in musicians. The goal of this study was to use a large sample of college students with normal hearing (n = 160) to compare OAE SNRs in musicians and non-musicians and to explore potential effects of training recency and noise exposure on OAEs in these cohorts. The musician cohort included both active musicians (who at the time of enrollment practiced at least weekly) and past musicians (who had at least 6 years of training). All participants completed a questionnaire about recent noise exposure (previous 12 months), and a subset of participants (71 musicians and 15 non-musicians) wore a personal noise dosimeter for one week to obtain a more nuanced and objective measure of exposure to assess how different exposure levels may affect OAEs before the emergence of a clinically significant hearing loss. OAEs were tested using both transient-evoked OAEs (TEOAEs) and distortion-product OAEs (DPOAEs). As predicted from the literature, musicians experienced significantly higher noise levels than non-musicians based on both subjective (self-reported) and objective measures. Yet we found stronger TEOAEs and DPOAEs in musicians compared to non-musicians in the ∼1–5 kHz range. Comparisons between past and active musicians suggest that enhanced cochlear function in young adult musicians does not require active, ongoing musical practice. Although there were no significant relations between OAEs and noise exposure as measured by dosimetry or questionnaire, active musicians had weaker DPOAEs than past musicians when the entire DPOAE frequency range was considered (up to ∼16 kHz), consistent with a subclinical noise-induced hearing loss that only becomes apparent when active musicians are contrasted with a cohort of individuals with comparable training but without the ongoing risks of noise exposure. Our findings suggest, therefore, that separate norms should be developed for musicians for earlier detection of incipient hearing loss. Potential explanations for enhanced cochlear function in musicians include pre-existing (inborn or demographic) differences, training-related enhancements of cochlear function (e.g., upregulation of prestin, stronger efferent feedback mechanisms), or a combination thereof. Further studies are needed to determine if OAE enhancements offer musicians protection against damage caused by noise exposure.

N2  - Playing musical instruments places unusually high demands on specific parts of the human body. Relative to the instruments they play, musicians may experience instrument-related symptoms, as recorded in flute players. The objective was to provide an overview of the study findings addressing medical problems in flautists to better understand their complaints and pave the way for more personalized healthcare. Several electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library) were systematically searched in July 2022. Furthermore, the references of all included articles were reviewed for additionally relevant sources. The resulting set of studies was summarized in a table, with quality assessment according to the SIGN grading system. From an initial 433 hits, the search yielded 95 studies with a total of 32,600 musicians, including at least 2134 flautists. Among the latter, evidence was found for musculoskeletal, neurological, dermatological, temporomandibular, and hearing complaints, overuse and reflux symptoms, velopharyngeal insufficiency, as well as upper and lower airway impairment. Other specialists may be consulted equally often and should be sensitive to the particular medical problems in flautists. Future studies would ideally contain specific outcome analyses on an international scale and consider flautists as an individual subgroup within a larger number of total participants.

N2  - A 62-year-old musician—MM—developed amusia after a right middle-cerebral-artery infarction. Initially, MM showed melodic deficits while discriminating pitch-related differences in melodies, musical memory problems, and impaired sensitivity to tonal structures, but normal pitch discrimination and spectral resolution thresholds, and normal cognitive and language abilities. His rhythmic processing was intact when pitch variations were removed. After 3 months, MM showed a large improvement in his sensitivity to tonality, but persistent melodic deficits and a decline in perceiving the metric structure of rhythmic sequences. We also found visual cues aided melodic processing, which is novel and beneficial for future rehabilitation practice.

N2  - This case report presents the story of Mr. S, a professional orchestral musician with declining musical sight-reading ability, followed by progressive visuospatial and language deficits. Our novel musical assessment battery revealed deficits in music-reading (musical alexia) and music-writing (musical agraphia), with spared auditory perception and expression. Taken with neuropsychological testing, clinical history, and imaging, we conclude that his symptoms evolved from musical alexia to a multidomain, neurodegenerative process centered in the dominant inferior parietal lobe and temporoparietal junction. We suspect a primary TDP-opathy with comorbid preclinical Alzheimer’s disease. Mr. S’s case highlights musical symptoms as meaningful, early indicators of neurodegeneration.

N2  - Introduction: Musicians are exposed to music at high intensities and are at risk for developing noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). Since hearing is so important to their career, they deserve special consideration. To avoid the deleterious effects of loud music, professionals should be sensitized to noise exposure and the use of strategies to prevent NIHL. The current study aimed to assess the knowledge and attitude towards noise-induced hearing disorders and hearing-conservative practices among professional musicians. Methods: A Knowledge, Attitude and Practice (KAP) questionnaire was developed and administered among 136 professional musicians belonging to the folk/ light music genre in Chennai between March & April 2021. The participants were 115 males and 21 females, ranging in age from 18 to 75 years, with a mean age of 29 ±11 years. Results: 80% of musicians were aware of the nature and cause of NIHL, but knowledge of NIHL prevention and treatment was limited to a few (16%). The majority (84%) had a misconception that using cotton or fingers to plug the ears is a protective strategy against NIHL. Only 15% of participants reported having used Ear Protective Devices (EPDs). Conclusion: Although musicians are aware of the risks of exposure to loud noise, they seldom use hearing protection. It is, therefore, vital to provide crucial information regarding NIHL and its prevention and promote musicians for better hearing preservation practices.

N2  - Background Music-induced hearing loss (MIHL) is a critical public health issue. During music instruction, students and teachers are at risk of developing hearing loss due to exposure to loud and unsafe sound levels that can exceed 100 dBA. Prevention of MIHL in music students must be a desired action of all music educators. Purpose To promote deliberate changes in music instruction and encourage more moderate sound creation and exposure during music education, it is essential to equip the instructors with live dynamic tools to monitor the overall sound intensities during music instruction. Equally important data to convey to the instructors are information regarding the intensity and duration of sounds at specific frequency regions in the music they are generating. Unfortunately, there are no feasible techniques to track cumulative live music exposures at various frequencies nor are there any guidelines for safe music exposure. Research Design We created a visually appealing, user-friendly dashboard prototype system to display the accumulated time and intensity of sound exposure during live classes/rehearsals categorized into three frequency ranges. These visuals can be easily understood at a glance allowing musicians and instructors to make informed decisions about how to play music safely. Experimental Approach and Results The dashboard included a collection of circular dial graphs that displayed in real time the accumulated sound exposure in the instructor’s selected frequency range and showed the percentage of the maximum daily sound exposure based on the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health Standards (NIOSH, 1998). Although NIOSH standards are not widely applied for music exposure, we propose that these standards can be used to provide initial guidelines to develop critical levels of music exposure. Additionally, the dashboard included a color-coded equalizer that displayed the instantaneous frequency distribution of sounds to indicate if sound levels at specific frequencies were too high even for short-term exposure. Conclusion Less expensive than existing technology and more convenient to use, this dashboard will enable music instructors to make informed decisions on how to best adapt their teaching approaches to protect the hearing health of their students.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Many studies have examined the perception of musical emotion using excerpts from familiar music that includes highly expressed emotions to classify emotional choices. However, using familiar music to study musical emotions in people with acquired hearing loss could produce ambiguous results as to whether the emotional perception is due to previous experiences or listening to the current musical stimuli. To overcome this limitation, we developed new musical stimuli to study emotional perception without the effects of episodic memory. METHODS: A musician was instructed to compose five melodies with evenly distributed pitches around 1 kHz. The melodies were created to express the emotions of happy, sad, angry, tender, and neutral. To evaluate whether these melodies expressed the intended emotions, two methods were applied. First, we classified the expressed emotions of melodies with selected musical features from 60 features using genetic algorithm-based k-nearest neighbors. Second, forty-four people with normal hearing participated in an online survey regarding the emotional perception of music based on dimensional and discrete approaches to evaluate the musical stimuli set. RESULTS: Twenty-four selected musical features produced classification for intended emotions with an accuracy of 76%. The results of the online survey in the normal hearing (NH) group showed that the intended emotions were selected significantly more often than the others. K-means clustering analysis revealed that melodies with arousal and valence ratings corresponded to representative quadrants of interest. Additionally, the applicability of the stimuli was tested in 4 individuals with high-frequency hearing loss. CONCLUSION: By applying the individuals with NH, the musical stimuli were shown to classify emotions with high accuracy, as expressed. These results confirm that the set of musical stimuli can be used to study the perceived emotion in music, demonstrating the validity of the musical stimuli, independent of innate musical bias such as due to episodic memory. Furthermore, musical stimuli could be helpful for further studying perceived musical emotion in people with hearing loss because of the controlled pitch for each emotion.

N2  - Music is among the most important artistic, cultural, and entertainment modalities in any society. With the proliferation of music genres and the technological advances that allow people to consume music in any location and at any time, music over-exposure has become a significant public health issue. Music-induced hearing loss has a great deal in common with noise-induced hearing loss. However, there are important differences that make music a unique insult to the auditory system and a unique threat to public health. Its unique properties also make it a potentially valuable asset in sound conditioning paradigms. This review discusses hearing loss from noise and music, comparing and contrasting the two. Recent research on music-induced hearing loss is reviewed, followed by discussion of the differences in music-induced hearing loss between performers and consumers. The review concludes with a discussion of the potential of music as a sound conditioning stimulus to protect against acquired hearing loss.

N2  - Introduction: Sensorineural hearing loss caused by exposure to noise is one of the most frequent causes of deafness. Professional musicians have significant occupational exposure to high levels of noise. Use of hearing protection among musicians could substantially prevent hearing damage, though the rate of use is quite low. Methods and material: A questionnaire on the use of protective hearing devices, hearing care, and subjective judgments of hearing difficulties was completed by a group of classical musicians from Spain. We analysed the frequency of device use by instrument based on contingency tables analysed by χ2 tests. Results: One hundred and ninety-four Spanish classical orchestral musicians voluntarily completed the questionnaire. The percentage of musicians who reported using hearing protection in our survey was very low and varied with the type of instrument played. However, we found a high prevalence of subjective auditory disorders within this group. Conclusion: Few Spanish musicians use hearing protection. Training on hearing-loss prevention in this field and better protective devices could increase device use and improve the auditory health of this group.

N2  - This study aimed to determine (a) the influence of noise exposure background (NEB) on the peripheral and central auditory system functioning and (b) the influence of NEB on speech recognition in noise abilities in student musicians. Twenty non-musician students with self-reported low NEB and 18 student musicians with self-reported high NEB completed a battery of tests that consisted of physiological measures, including auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) at three different stimulus rates (11.3 Hz, 51.3 Hz, and 81.3 Hz), and P300, and behavioral measures including conventional and extended high-frequency audiometry, consonant–vowel nucleus–consonant (CNC) word test and AzBio sentence test for assessing speech perception in noise abilities at −9, −6, −3, 0, and +3 dB signal to noise ratios (SNRs). The NEB was negatively associated with performance on the CNC test at all five SNRs. A negative association was found between NEB and performance on the AzBio test at 0 dB SNR. No effect of NEB was found on the amplitude and latency of P300 and the ABR wave I amplitude. More investigations of larger datasets with different NEB and longitudinal measurements are needed to investigate the influence of NEB on word recognition in noise and to understand the specific cognitive processes contributing to the impact of NEB on word recognition in noise.

N2  - Background: Understanding healthy brain ageing has become vital as populations are ageing rapidly and age-related brain diseases are becoming more common. In normal brain ageing, speech processing undergoes functional reorganisation involving reductions of hemispheric asymmetry and overactivation in the prefrontal regions. However, little is known about how these changes generalise to other vocal production, such as singing, and how they are affected by associated cognitive demands. Methods: The present cross-sectional fMRI study systematically maps the neural correlates of vocal production across adulthood (N=100, age 21–88 years) using a balanced 2x3 design where tasks varied in modality (speech: proverbs / singing: song phrases) and cognitive demand (repetition / completion from memory / improvisation). Results: In speech production, ageing was associated with decreased left pre- and postcentral activation across tasks and increased bilateral angular and right inferior temporal and fusiform activation in the improvisation task. In singing production, ageing was associated with increased activation in medial and bilateral prefrontal and parietal regions in the completion task, whereas other tasks showed no ageing effects. Direct comparisons between the modalities showed larger age-related activation changes in speech than singing across tasks, including a larger left-to-right shift in lateral prefrontal regions in the improvisation task. Conclusion: The present results suggest that the brains’ singing network undergoes differential functional reorganisation in normal ageing compared to the speech network, particularly during a task with high executive demand. These findings are relevant for understanding the effects of ageing on vocal production as well as how singing can support communication in healthy ageing and neurological rehabilitation.

N2  - The Department of Defense is the largest employer of full-time musicians. In the U.S. military, many musicians experience unique occupational exposures such as extended periods of standing, sitting, and marching for rehearsals and performances, static and non-neutral postures, and a variety of repetitive motions while playing instruments. These exposures are in addition to physical training and fitness standards required of U.S. Army soldiers. METHODS: An electronic survey was administered to active-duty U.S. Army Band musicians. The survey collected demographics, personal characteristics, Army Physical Fitness Test performance, occupational demands, health behaviors, and injuries from October 2017 to December 2018. Survey responses were combined with medical and physical fitness performance records. Descriptive statistics were reported and factors associated with injuries were investigated. RESULTS: There were 465 Army Band members in this population, with approximately half (49%) completing the survey. Most survey respondents (81%) reported an injury in the past year, which they predominantly attributed to overuse (54%). Leading reported activities resulting in injury included running for physical training (21%), repetitive movements while playing an instrument (11%), and standing while playing (11%). A majority of survey respondents (60%) also had a medical encounter for an injury. Factors significantly associated with injury among men were lower aerobic fitness and higher body fat percentage; additional unadjusted factors associated with injury among all Army Band soldiers included female sex, older age, and longer periods of marching and standing while playing. CONCLUSIONS: Injury prevention initiatives for Army Band musicians should focus on the reduction of overuse and repetitive motion injuries. Suggested prevention strategies include balanced physical training, ergonomic adjustments, rehearsal breaks, and leadership support for injury prevention efforts.

N2  - A cochlear implant (CI) is a prosthesis that allows people with severe to profound hearing loss to understand speech in quiet settings. However, listening to music presents a challenge to most CI users; they often do not enjoy music or avoid it altogether. The Musi-CI training course was developed for CI users with the goal of reducing music aversion and improving music enjoyment. A consortium was established consisting of a professional musician with CI, CI rehabilitation professionals and researchers. Participatory action research (PAR) was applied to develop and evaluate the training experiences, collaborating with 37 CI users during three cycles of eight training sessions, each held over a period of 3 months. Input and feedback were collected after each training session using questionnaires, observations and focus group interviews. Almost all participants (86%) completed the training. After completing the training a large majority of participants reported increased music appreciation, increased social participation in musical settings and a positive impact on general auditory perception. The resulting Musi-CI training programme focuses on music listening skills, self-efficacy, and self-motivation. It consists of exercises intended to strengthen attention and working memory, to improve beat and rhythm perception (with online rhythm exercises) and exercises to distinguish timbre of instruments and emotion in music. A Melody Game was developed to improve pitch and melodic contour discrimination.
