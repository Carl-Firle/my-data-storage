# This is the repository for the evaluation sheets of <br><br> `Aerosol emission rates from breathing, speaking, and speaking with a surgical mask`
## https://doi.org/

The Wolfram Mathematica files are created with the Version 13.0.1.
The order is prescribed by the starting index number.

+ 01_WallLossCorrection = evaluates the effect of wall loss absorption (will be neglected in proceeding process due to minor error variance)
+ 02_Aerosol 0180 = task plots for particle emission rate
+ 03_Aerosol 0112 = export of all task and correlation plots (no wall loss correction)
+ 04_EmissionRates 0006 ... 0008 = Likelihood analysis and lognormal fit
