AB  - Rapid advances over the last decade in DNA sequencing and statistical genetics 
      enable us to investigate the genomic makeup of individuals throughout history. In 
      a recent notable study, Begg et al.(1) used Ludwig van Beethoven's hair strands 
      for genome sequencing and explored genetic predispositions for some of his 
      documented medical issues. Given that it was arguably Beethoven's skills as a 
      musician and composer that made him an iconic figure in Western culture, we here 
      extend the approach and apply it to musicality. We use this as an example to 
      illustrate the broader challenges of individual-level genetic predictions.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Musicians who wear hearing aids are a unique subset of 
      hearing-impaired individuals. There are a number of issues musicians experience 
      with hearing aids, making effective hearing rehabilitation a challenge. Research 
      suggests hearing aid satisfaction in musicians is lower partly due to their 
      advanced listening skills, however, qualitative research addressing musicians who 
      wear hearing aids for music is scarce. The current study aimed to record the 
      barriers encountered by musicians who wear hearing aids when playing their 
      instrument/singing, listening to recorded music and listening to live music. 
      DESIGN: Professional musicians who wear hearing aids were interviewed. 
      Participants were questioned about their experiences with hearing loss and 
      hearing aids, with particular emphasis on experiences listening to recorded and 
      live music, and playing or performing music with the hearing aids. STUDY SAMPLE: 
      Eight professional musicians were interviewed, using a semi-structured interview 
      style, with a question and prompt guide. RESULTS: Thematic analysis revealed 
      three main themes in the data: the musicians' journey, communication, and 
      flexibility/adjustability. CONCLUSIONS: The results have implications for future 
      research into specific fitting parameters for hearing aids for musicians 
      (particularly for music performance), the need for evidence-based rehabilitation 
      programs for musicians with hearing loss, and the need for a glossary of terms to 
      assist communication between Audiologists and musicians.

AB  - Hearing health, a cornerstone for musical performance and appreciation, often 
      stands at odds with the unique acoustical challenges that musicians face. 
      Utilizing a cross-sectional design, this survey-based study presents an in-depth 
      examination of self-rated hearing health and its contributing factors in 370 
      professional and 401 amateur musicians recruited from German-speaking orchestras. 
      To probe the nuanced differences between these groups, a balanced subsample of 
      200 professionals and 200 amateurs was curated, matched based on age, gender, and 
      instrument family. The findings revealed that two-thirds of respondents reported 
      hearing-related issues, prevalent in both professional and amateur musicians and 
      affecting music-related activities as well as social interactions. The 
      comparative analysis indicates that professionals experienced nearly four times 
      more lifetime music noise exposure compared to amateurs and faced more hearing 
      challenges in social contexts, but not in musical settings. Professionals 
      exhibited greater awareness about hearing health and were more proactive in using 
      hearing protection devices compared to their amateur counterparts. Notably, only 
      9% of professional musicians' playing hours and a mere 1% of amateurs' playing 
      hours were fully protected. However, with respect to their attitudes toward 
      hearing aids, professional musicians exhibited a noticeable aversion. In general, 
      an increase in music-related problems (alongside hearing difficulties in daily 
      life) was associated with a decrease in mental health-related quality of life. 
      This research highlights the importance of proactive hearing health measures 
      among both professional and amateur musicians and underscores the need for 
      targeted interventions that address musicians' specific hearing health challenges 
      and stigmatization concerns about hearing aids.

TI  - Prevalence of hearing loss in college students: a meta-analysis.
PG  - 1282829
LID - 10.3389/fnins.2023.1282829 [doi]
LID - 1282829
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Hearing loss among college students, specifically noise-induced 
      hearing loss (NIHL), appears to be increasing. This may be particularly 
      challenging for this population as college students are required to listen to 
      lectures in classrooms that may have suboptimal listening environments. 
      College-aged musicians are at a particularly high risk due to repeated and 
      extended exposure to loud noise. Therefore, the purpose of the current study was 
      (1) to examine the prevalence of hearing loss in college students and (2) to 
      emphasize the importance of detecting hearing loss at 6,000 Hz. METHODS: A 
      meta-analysis was conducted using the PRISMA model. The literature search yielded 
      8 studies (1,950 subjects) that tested hearing loss using an audiogram and 
      Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emissions (DPOAEs). All studies used audiologic 
      tests to detect hearing loss among college students between the ages of 
      17-35 years. RESULTS: Results indicate that the prevalence of hearing loss in 
      college students is 19%. In addition, the prevalence of hearing loss at 6,000 Hz 
      is 85% among student musicians. For this meta-analysis, slight sensorineural 
      hearing loss, or thresholds greater than 20 dB bilaterally or unilaterally, 
      qualified as hearing loss. DISCUSSION: Decreased hearing at 6,000 Hz may lead to 
      an individual's inability to hear important environmental factors and high 
      frequency speech sounds. College students without full auditory function at this 
      frequency may have difficulties performing in class based on decreased attention, 
      comprehension, and memory. Although students may not realize the influence of 
      their 6,000 Hz hearing loss or be unaware of its presence, it could significantly 
      change their likelihood to succeed in college. Therefore, implementing a hearing 
      conservation program may be advised for colleges and universities to help prevent 
      hearing loss in students, particularly for collegiate musicians. In addition, it 
      may be beneficial to screen hearing in college students at 6,000 Hz for better 
      detection of hearing loss overall.

LID - 10.2147/JMDH.S448301 [doi]
AB  - Playing musical instruments places unusually high demands on specific parts of 
      the human body. Relative to the instruments they play, musicians may experience 
      instrument-related symptoms, as recorded in flute players. The objective was to 
      provide an overview of the study findings addressing medical problems in 
      flautists to better understand their complaints and pave the way for more 
      personalized healthcare. Several electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane 
      Library) were systematically searched in July 2022. Furthermore, the references 
      of all included articles were reviewed for additionally relevant sources. The 
      resulting set of studies was summarized in a table, with quality assessment 
      according to the SIGN grading system. From an initial 433 hits, the search 
      yielded 95 studies with a total of 32,600 musicians, including at least 2134 
      flautists. Among the latter, evidence was found for musculoskeletal, 
      neurological, dermatological, temporomandibular, and hearing complaints, overuse 
      and reflux symptoms, velopharyngeal insufficiency, as well as upper and lower 
      airway impairment. Other specialists may be consulted equally often and should be 
      sensitive to the particular medical problems in flautists. Future studies would 
      ideally contain specific outcome analyses on an international scale and consider 
      flautists as an individual subgroup within a larger number of total participants.

AB  - Chronic exposure to loud sound leads to noise-induced hearing loss. This is 
      especially common in collegiate-level musicians. Existing methods for estimating 
      exposure typically do not consider genre- or instrument-specific variability in 
      soundscape/spectral characteristics. We measured sound exposure levels (SELs) 
      across instruments, bands, and genres at a university music school. We found (1) 
      considerable variability in SELs across instruments and bands, (2) that Jazz 
      musicians are consistently exposed to the highest sound levels, and (3) that 
      spectral features of music differ between instrument type and genre, and based on 
      room size. These findings highlight the need for tailored guidelines that 
      moderate the implementation of hearing conservation initiatives for collegiate 
      musicians.

AB  - Musicians create sound that is enjoyable to themselves and their audience, but 
      this same sound also threatens their hearing health due to high sound pressure 
      levels generated by their own and their fellow musicians' instruments. Here we 
      seek to identify musicians' hearing health awareness in relation to their coping 
      strategies. 370 professional and 401 amateur musicians in total responded to a 
      questionnaire on hearing health, which included quantitative elements and 
      open-ended questions. Findings reveal that musicians are generally aware of 
      hearing health risks but also indicate a lack of discussion on that topic. 
      However, inasmuch as respondents consider hearing protection as necessary, they 
      articulate justified concerns about its potential impact on quality of 
      performance and musical communication. In sum, musicians show literacy regarding 
      their hearing health, but more guidance and training is needed to ensure 
      effective protective measures.

AB  - Music is complex. There are risks to hearing health associated with playing due 
      to excessive sound exposure. Face the Music is an on-going cross-sectional 
      project to assess the risks to unamplified classical musicians. Key findings over 
      the first fifteen years are presented based on the research undertaken with a 
      leading conservatoire on more than 5000 classical music students. The work covers 
      hearing health surveillance, education and awareness, sound exposure, and new 
      technology. The future of the research programme is discussed along with 
      opportunities in objective hearing health assessment and new acoustic solutions. 
      A lot has changed in fifteen years, but the research was driven by a change in 
      United Kingdom legislation. It is hoped that the research results can inform 
      future regulation.

TI  - Temporal resolution and pitch discrimination in music education: novel data in 
      children.
PG  - 4103-4111
LID - 10.1007/s00405-024-08571-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rehabilitation of hearing and listening difficulties through 
      neuroplasticity of the auditory nervous system is a promising technique. Evidence 
      of enhanced auditory processing in adult musicians is often not based on clinical 
      auditory processing tests and is lacking in children with musical education. 
      PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to investigate the temporal resolution and 
      frequency discrimination elements of auditory processing both in adults and 
      children with musical education and to compare them with those without any 
      musical education. METHODS: Participants consisted of ten children without 
      musical training and ten children with musical training with mean age 11.3 years 
      and range 8-15 years as well as ten adults without musical education and ten 
      adults with musical education with mean age 38.1 years and range 30-45 years. All 
      participants were tested with two temporal resolution tests (GIN:Gaps-In-Noise 
      and RGDT:Random Gap Detection Test), a temporal ordering frequency test 
      (FPT:Frequency Pattern Test), and a frequency discrimination test (DLF: Different 
      Limen for Frequency). RESULTS: All test results revealed better performance in 
      both children and adults with musical training for both ears. CONCLUSION: A 
      positive effect of formal music education for specific auditory processing 
      elements in both children and adults is documented. Larger samples, longitudinal 
      studies, as well as groups with impaired hearing and/or auditory processing are 
      needed to further substantiate the effect shown.

AB  - Musicians are at risk of hearing loss and tinnitus due to regular exposure to 
      high levels of noise. This level of risk may have been underestimated previously 
      since damage to the auditory system, such as cochlear synaptopathy, may not be 
      easily detectable using standard clinical measures. Most previous research 
      investigating hearing loss in musicians has involved cross-sectional study 
      designs that may capture only a snapshot of hearing health in relation to noise 
      exposure. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of cumulative 
      noise exposure on behavioural, electrophysiological, and self-report indices of 
      hearing damage in early-career musicians and non-musicians with normal hearing 
      over a 2-year period. Participants completed an annual test battery consisting of 
      pure tone audiometry, extended high-frequency hearing thresholds, distortion 
      product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs), speech perception in noise, auditory 
      brainstem responses, and self-report measures of tinnitus, hyperacusis, and 
      hearing in background noise. Participants also completed the Noise Exposure 
      Structured Interview to estimate cumulative noise exposure across the study 
      period. Linear mixed models assessed changes over time. The longitudinal analysis 
      comprised 64 early-career musicians (female n = 34; age range at T0 = 18-26 
      years) and 30 non-musicians (female n = 20; age range at T0 = 18-27 years). There 
      were few longitudinal changes as a result of musicianship. Small improvements 
      over time in some measures may be attributable to a practice/test-retest effect. 
      Some measures (e.g., DPOAE indices of outer hair cell function) were associated 
      with noise exposure at each time point, but did not show a significant change 
      over time. A small proportion of participants reported a worsening of their 
      tinnitus symptoms, which participants attributed to noise exposure, or not using 
      hearing protection. Future longitudinal studies should attempt to capture the 
      effects of noise exposure over a longer period, taken at several time points, for 
      a precise measure of how hearing changes over time. Hearing conservation 
      programmes for "at risk" individuals should closely monitor DPOAEs to detect 
      early signs of noise-induced hearing loss when audiometric thresholds are 
      clinically normal.

AB  - Otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) are a non-invasive metric of cochlear function. 
      Studies of OAEs in musicians have yielded mixed results, ranging from evidence of 
      diminished OAEs in musicians-suggesting noise-induced hearing loss-to no 
      difference when compared to non-musicians, or even a trend for stronger OAEs in 
      musicians. The goal of this study was to use a large sample of college students 
      with normal hearing (n = 160) to compare OAE SNRs in musicians and non-musicians 
      and to explore potential effects of training recency and noise exposure on OAEs 
      in these cohorts. The musician cohort included both active musicians (who at the 
      time of enrollment practiced at least weekly) and past musicians (who had at 
      least 6 years of training). All participants completed a questionnaire about 
      recent noise exposure (previous 12 months), and a subset of participants (71 
      musicians and 15 non-musicians) wore a personal noise dosimeter for one week to 
      obtain a more nuanced and objective measure of exposure to assess how different 
      exposure levels may affect OAEs before the emergence of a clinically significant 
      hearing loss. OAEs were tested using both transient-evoked OAEs (TEOAEs) and 
      distortion-product OAEs (DPOAEs). As predicted from the literature, musicians 
      experienced significantly higher noise levels than non-musicians based on both 
      subjective (self-reported) and objective measures. Yet we found stronger TEOAEs 
      and DPOAEs in musicians compared to non-musicians in the ∼1-5 kHz range. 
      Comparisons between past and active musicians suggest that enhanced cochlear 
      function in young adult musicians does not require active, ongoing musical 
      practice. Although there were no significant relations between OAEs and noise 
      exposure as measured by dosimetry or questionnaire, active musicians had weaker 
      DPOAEs than past musicians when the entire DPOAE frequency range was considered 
      (up to ∼16 kHz), consistent with a subclinical noise-induced hearing loss that 
      only becomes apparent when active musicians are contrasted with a cohort of 
      individuals with comparable training but without the ongoing risks of noise 
      exposure. Our findings suggest, therefore, that separate norms should be 
      developed for musicians for earlier detection of incipient hearing loss. 
      Potential explanations for enhanced cochlear function in musicians include 
      pre-existing (inborn or demographic) differences, training-related enhancements 
      of cochlear function (e.g., upregulation of prestin, stronger efferent feedback 
      mechanisms), or a combination thereof. Further studies are needed to determine if 
      OAE enhancements offer musicians protection against damage caused by noise 
      exposure.

TI  - A Survey on Knowledge, Attitude & Practice of Yakshagana Mela Artists Towards 
      Music-Induced Hearing Loss.
PG  - 2480-2489

AB  - PURPOSE: Yakshagana is a type of folk-art theatre portraying mythological and 
      historical stories. It includes artists who play predominantly percussion 
      instruments besides cymbals and harmonium. Professional musicians exposing 
      themselves to deafening sounds are prone to develop noise-induced complications. 
      [1] One such professional in the coastal districts of Karnataka state is a 
      Yakshagana himmela (backstage) artist. There is no reported literature concerning 
      these artists' hearing health and problems. Hence, the proposed study was aimed 
      at developing, validating and assessing the Knowledge, Attitude and Practice (KAP 
      )of Yakshagana Mela artists towards Music-Induced Hearing Loss (MIHL), a possible 
      risk factor of their profession. METHOD: This study was carried out on 139 
      yakshagana mela artists with a mean age of 41.63 years. It was conducted in two 
      phases. In the first phase, an expert committee discussion was conducted to 
      verify, modify and validate the questionnaire. The second phase included the 
      administration of the developed questionnaire on the artists. RESULTS: The sum 
      scores for each domain of KAP were computed. Scores above 80% were defined as 
      good knowledge, practice, and a positive attitude. The findings of the study 
      revealed that more than half of the participants demonstrated inadequate 
      knowledge (63.3%) and negative attitude (63.7%), but a fair level of practice 
      (65.4%). CONCLUSION: From the outcome of the present study, it can be inferred 
      that in spite of being in a profession with a high risk of MIHL, the participants 
      considered hearing health as their least priority. The study illustrates the need 
      for initiating hearing and conservation programs to improve awareness & combat 
      music induced hearing loss in this population.

AB  - The musician Ludwig van Beethoven suffered from progressive hearing loss and 
      abdominal pain, both of which can be explained by lead intoxication. With genomic 
      analyses, Begg et al. (2023) have confirmed that the five locks of hair 
      attributed to Beethoven were authentic. Moreover, the possible cause of his 
      severe liver disease was revealed. Rifai et al. (2024) have observed unusually 
      high lead levels in authenticated locks of hair from Beethoven. Based on the new 
      pieces of evidence, we conclude that his hearing loss and gastrointestinal 
      complaints were caused by plumbism.

TI  - Person-centered aural rehabilitation program improved mood, cognition, and 
      auditory processing in a professional musician who uses a hearing aid and 
      cochlear implant: Case Report.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Aural rehabilitation focused on music for individuals with cochlear 
      implants (CIs) and/or hearing aids (HAs) typically emphasizes perceptual skills 
      rather than enjoyment of music. Yet, those with CIs and/or HAs often struggle to 
      enjoy music, complaining that it sounds distorted with the implant or HAs. 
      Typically, aural rehabilitation programs require a significant time commitment, 
      but this may not be feasible or preferable for many patients. This study aimed to 
      evaluate the efficacy of two individualized intensive 3-week home practice 
      programs focused on enjoyment of music, a personal goal for this subject. 
      METHODS: The subject was a professional musician who used a CI and HA. Cognitive 
      measures of global cognitive function, executive function, processing speed, 
      auditory working memory, visual-spatial abilities, verbal fluency, and 
      auditory-verbal memory, as well as auditory electrophysiology (EEG) measures were 
      conducted pre-post experiment 2. Two experiments were undertaken to evaluate 
      responses to two practice programs that incorporated different variations in 
      listening dosage and intervention activities. RESULTS: Experiment 1 resulted in 
      minimal measurable improvements related to music likability ratings, with the 
      highest dosage condition showing a small increase in average likability rating 
      from baseline to week 3. The results of experiment 2 revealed an improvement in 
      likability ratings only when dosage steadily increased each week. The subject 
      also reported improved mood and decreased frustration during weeks two and three 
      of experiment 2. Finally, we found improvement pre-post experiment 2 on several 
      cognitive and EEG measures. DISCUSSION: The results of these experiments are 
      encouraging and support the use of an individualized, person-centered, and 
      semi-structured home practice program to increase music enjoyment and improve 
      quality of life and auditory processing for individuals with hearing loss. Future 
      studies should aim to increase sample size and explore pairing person-centered 
      home practice programs with concurrent clinician-lead aural rehabilitation.

TI  - Patient-Led Research to Develop a Training Programme for Restoring Musical Joy in 
      Cochlear Implant Recipients: A Reflexive Process Evaluation.
PG  - e14133

AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of patients in healthcare research is slowly evolving, 
      although patient roles in the research process are limited. This paper reports on 
      a patient-led research project aiming to develop a musical hearing training 
      programme for patients with a cochlear implant (CI): the Musi-CI programme. A CI 
      is an inner ear prosthesis that allows people with severe hearing loss to hear. 
      However, while speech can be understood, CI users cannot fully enjoy music or 
      feel aversion to it. The Musi-CI programme aims to reduce this music aversion to 
      ultimately improve music enjoyment and social participation. The development of 
      the Musi-CI programme was supported by a consortium of professionals in CI 
      rehabilitation and research. The aim of this paper is to describe and evaluate 
      the Musi-CI programme development process and its impact on professional CI 
      rehabilitation and research. METHODS: Programme development was described using a 
      3-layered process model of action research, distinguishing the CI user process, 
      the healthcare professional process and the research process. To evaluate 
      perceptions on the programme development process, consortium partners provided 
      written comments and participated in a reflexive evaluation session that was 
      video-recorded. Reflexive evaluation aims for collective learning and 
      strengthening collaboration among participants. Written comments and video data 
      were analysed using template analysis. RESULTS: The involvement of an expert by 
      experience was perceived as challenging but rewarding for all consortium 
      partners, opening up new perspectives on CI-rehabilitation practice and research. 
      Data analysis revealed two themes on the programme development process, 
      professional space and acknowledgement, and two themes on the outcomes on CI 
      rehabilitation and research: critical reflection and paradigm shift. CONCLUSION: 
      Experts by experience represent a different knowledge domain that may contribute 
      to change in rehabilitation and research. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: The 
      development of the programme was initiated by a professional musician and CI user 
      who organized the funding, had a leading role throughout the research process, 
      including the write-up of the results, and co-authored this paper.

AB  - Even with the use of hearing aids (HAs), speech in noise perception remains 
      challenging for older adults, impacting communication and quality of life 
      outcomes. The association between music perception and speech-in-noise (SIN) 
      outcomes is of interest, as there is evidence that professionally trained 
      musicians are adept listeners in noisy environments. Thus, this study explored 
      the association between music processing, cognitive factors, and the outcome 
      variable of SIN perception, in older adults with hearing loss. Forty-two HA users 
      aged between 57 and 90 years with a symmetrical, moderate to moderately-severe 
      hearing loss participated in this study. Our findings suggest that on beat rhythm 
      accuracy, pitch perception, and working memory all positively contribute to SIN 
      perception for older adults with hearing loss. These findings provide key 
      insights into the relationship between music, cognitive factors, and SIN 
      perception, which may inform future interventions, rehabilitation and the 
      mechanisms that support better SIN perception.

AB  - The most prevalent sensory impairment impacting the elderly is age-related 
      hearing loss (HL), which affects around 65% of individuals over the age of 60 
      years. This bilateral, symmetrical sensorineural impairment profoundly affects 
      auditory perception, speech discrimination, and the overall understanding of 
      auditory signals. Influenced by diverse factors, age-related HL can substantially 
      influence an individual's quality of life and mental health and can lead to 
      depression. Cochlear implantation (CI) stands as a standard intervention, yet 
      despite advancements, music perception challenges persist, which can be addressed 
      with individualized music therapy. This case report describes the journey of an 
      81-year-old musician through profound sensorineural hearing loss, cochlear 
      implantation, and rehabilitative music therapy. Auditory evaluations, musical 
      exercises, and quality of life assessments highlighted meaningful improvements in 
      music perception, auditory skills, and overall satisfaction post-implantation. 
      Music therapy facilitated emotional, functional, and musical levels of 
      engagement, notably enhancing his ability to perceive melody, rhythm, and 
      different instruments. Moreover, subjective assessments and audiograms indicated 
      marked improvements in auditory differentiation, music enjoyment, and overall 
      hearing thresholds. This comprehensive approach integrating bilateral CIs and 
      music therapy showcased audiological and quality of life enhancements in an 
      elderly individual with profound hearing loss, emphasizing the efficacy of this 
      combined treatment approach.

TI  - Effects of Noise Exposure on Peripheral Auditory Function, Binaural Envelope 
      Coding, and Speech Perception in Student Musicians With Normal Hearing.
LID - 10.1097/AUD.0000000000001609 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Musicians face an increased risk of hearing loss due to prolonged and 
      repetitive exposure to high-noise levels. Detecting early signs of hearing loss, 
      which are subtle and often elusive to traditional clinical tests like pure-tone 
      audiometry, is essential. The objective of this study was to investigate the 
      impact of noise exposure on the electrophysiological and perceptual aspects of 
      subclinical hearing damage in young musicians with normal audiometric thresholds. 
      DESIGN: The study included 33 musicians and 33 nonmusicians, all aged between 21 
      and 35 years, with normal audiometric thresholds. Participants underwent a 
      comprehensive test battery, which encompassed standard and extended 
      high-frequency (EHF) pure-tone audiometry (0.25 to 16 kHz), a Noise Exposure 
      Structured Interview, auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) to clicks at various 
      presentation rates and levels, thresholds for detecting interaural envelope time 
      difference, and a spatial release from masking (SRM) paradigm in which the target 
      speech was presented in the presence of either colocated or spatially separated 
      time-reversed two-talker babble. RESULTS: The results indicated the musician 
      group reported greater lifetime noise exposure than the nonmusician group, but 
      the Noise Exposure Structured Interview scores were neither correlated with the 
      ABR results nor with the speech perception outcomes. The ABR analyses indicated 
      diminished level-dependent growth and increased rate-dependent decline in wave I 
      amplitudes among musicians compared with nonmusicians. The student musicians 
      exhibited better binaural envelope processing skills than nonmusicians, 
      emphasizing their perceptual advantages in auditory processing associated with 
      musicianship. Speech perception results indicated no significant differences in 
      SRM between student musicians and nonmusicians. However, in both groups, 
      individuals with poorer EHF hearing exhibited reduced SRM compared with those 
      with normal EHF hearing, underscoring the importance of assessing and addressing 
      EHF hearing. CONCLUSIONS: Student musicians exhibit peripheral neural deficits; 
      however, no clear relation was found between these neural deficits and their 
      perceptual skills. Notably, reduced EHF thresholds were clearly related to 
      reduced SRM, which poses a challenge for speech perception in complex 
      multi-talker environments, affecting both musicians and nonmusicians alike.

TI  - A Pilot Dashboard System to Track Cumulative Exposure to Sound Levels during 
      Music Instruction: A Technical Report.
LID - 10.1055/s-0044-1791210 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND:  Music-induced hearing loss (MIHL) is a critical public health issue. 
      During music instruction, students and teachers are at risk of developing hearing 
      loss due to exposure to loud and unsafe sound levels that can exceed 100 dBA. 
      Prevention of MIHL in music students must be a desired action of all music 
      educators. PURPOSE:  To promote deliberate changes in music instruction and 
      encourage more moderate sound creation and exposure during music education, it is 
      essential to equip the instructors with live dynamic tools to monitor the overall 
      sound intensities during music instruction. Equally important data to convey to 
      the instructors are information regarding the intensity and duration of sounds at 
      specific frequency regions in the music they are generating. Unfortunately, there 
      are no feasible techniques to track cumulative live music exposures at various 
      frequencies nor are there any guidelines for safe music exposure. RESEARCH 
      DESIGN:  We created a visually appealing, user-friendly dashboard prototype 
      system to display the accumulated time and intensity of sound exposure during 
      live classes/rehearsals categorized into three frequency ranges. These visuals 
      can be easily understood at a glance allowing musicians and instructors to make 
      informed decisions about how to play music safely. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH AND 
      RESULTS:  The dashboard included a collection of circular dial graphs that 
      displayed in real time the accumulated sound exposure in the instructor's 
      selected frequency range and showed the percentage of the maximum daily sound 
      exposure based on the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health 
      Standards (NIOSH, 1998). Although NIOSH standards are not widely applied for 
      music exposure, we propose that these standards can be used to provide initial 
      guidelines to develop critical levels of music exposure. Additionally, the 
      dashboard included a color-coded equalizer that displayed the instantaneous 
      frequency distribution of sounds to indicate if sound levels at specific 
      frequencies were too high even for short-term exposure. CONCLUSION:  Less 
      expensive than existing technology and more convenient to use, this dashboard 
      will enable music instructors to make informed decisions on how to best adapt 
      their teaching approaches to protect the hearing health of their students.
